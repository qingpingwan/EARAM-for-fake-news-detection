The text seems to be a commentary on the situation in Iraq, possibly implying that the speaker is tired of the situation and wants others to leave him alone.

The text is in French and reads: "100 gags de fouet, si vous n'etes pas morts de rire!" This translates to "100 jokes of the whip, if you are not dead from laughter!"

This is a contentious issue, as it touches on the complex and often sensitive topic of religious freedom, tolerance, and the limits of satire.  The statement is potentially misleading because it oversimplifies the situation and ignores the fact that there have been instances of violence and other forms of extreme response to satire directed at other religious groups. It also fails to acknowledge the diversity within the Muslim community and the fact that the vast majority of Muslims do not condone or engage in violent responses to satire.

The text you provided does not go against common sense. It appears to be a factual statement about an event that took place in France, which is consistent with the image showing a large gathering of people, some of whom are wearing orange vests, which are often associated with emergency services or rescue personnel.

The text in the image appears to be a fictional or stylized representation of a "Wanted" poster, which is a common sense concept used to identify and locate individuals who are wanted by law enforcement.

However, the context of the image, which includes a man with a gun and the phrase "Yes we can," along with the names of individuals, might suggest a political or social commentary, which could be interpreted in various ways depending on the viewer's perspective. The phrase "Yes we can" is often associated with former U.S. President Barack Obama's campaign slogan, which could imply a political statement or critique.  It's important to note that the image is likely a piece of art or a graphic design meant to convey a message or to be humorous, rather than an actual wanted poster.

It suggests that the people who are critical of the Charlie Hebdo shootings are somehow complicit or part of the problem, which is a contentious statement.

This kind of statement goes against common sense because it is a form of victim blaming, which is the act of blaming the victim of a crime or tragedy for the harm they have suffered.

The text in the image reads, "He drew first, by @davpope #CharlieHebdo #JeSuisCharlie." This statement is a reference to the events surrounding the Charlie Hebdo shooting in January 2015, where a group of terrorists attacked the offices of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, killing 12 people. The statement is a play on the phrase "He drew first," which is a common phrase used to describe the first shot fired in a conflict.  The text is not factually accurate, as it is a creative or humorous take on the events rather than a literal description. The phrase "He drew first" is a play on words, suggesting that the person who drew the cartoon for Charlie Hebdo was the first to be attacked, which is not the case. The cartoonist, Charb, was indeed killed by the terrorists, but the phrase is a metaphorical way of saying that the cartoonist's work was the cause of the attack, which is a controversial and sensitive topic.  The text is also accompanied by an image of a cartoonist being shot, which is a visual representation of the tragic event. The image is a form of satire or commentary, and it is not intended to be factually accurate but rather to convey a message or to provoke thought and discussion.

The absurdity of the statement lies in the fact that it is a twisted justification for murder. In common sense, drawing a cartoon or expressing an opinion through satire is not a reason to take someone's life. The statement is a distortion of the principle of self-defense, which is typically used to justify the use of force in response to an immediate threat.  The image is a form of satire itself, using the medium of cartooning to comment on the absurdity of the terrorists' justification for their actions.

The text in the image is a quote attributed to Charb, which reads: "I am not afraid of retaliation. I have no kids, no wife, no car, no credit.

It is a personal reflection on the speaker's willingness to face potential danger rather than fleeing or hiding. The context of the quote, as it relates to the Paris shootings, suggests that the speaker is expressing a willingness to confront danger rather than avoiding it.  However, it's important to note that the quote is a personal opinion and not a universal truth or a guideline for everyone. People's reactions to danger can vary greatly based on their personal circumstances, values, and experiences.

The statement suggests that the media is being cowardly by not showing the Charlie Hebdo cartoons, and that Islam is the problem.  Whether or not this statement aligns with common sense depends on one's perspective and understanding of the context.

It is important to note that such a statement can be seen as promoting stereotypes and prejudice against followers of Islam.

The statement "Why is terrorism international &amp; weapons from terrorists always Russian (Soviet)!" is not necessarily against common sense, but it is a generalization that may not accurately reflect the reality of the situation.  Terrorism is indeed international, with groups operating across borders and often with connections to other countries. However, the origin of weapons used by terrorists can vary widely and is not necessarily linked to Russia or the Soviet Union. Terrorist groups may obtain weapons from a variety of sources, including legal and illegal arms markets, theft, or even through the black market.  The tweet's claim that weapons from terrorists are always Russian (Soviet) is a simplification and may not be supported by evidence.

The text in the image says, "Be careful, they might have pens."

Some might argue that the statement is a reasonable response to the attack, as it distinguishes between the actions of a few extremists and the religion of Islam. Others might argue that the statement is oversimplifying the issue, as the attack was carried out by individuals who claimed to be acting in the name of Islam.  In any case, the statement is a political opinion and not a factual statement. It is not a matter of common sense but a matter of interpretation and perspective.

The text in the image is a quote attributed to Tim Wolff, editor of German satire magazine Titanic. It reads: "If people want to shoot satirists‚Äîor want to shoot laughter itself‚Äîthen one simply has to respond by making jokes."  There is nothing inherently against common sense in this quote. It is a statement about the resilience of satire and the importance of humor in the face of adversity.

This is a common sense approach to dealing with challenges to freedom of expression.
The image you've provided appears to be a cartoon that is making a statement about the Charlie Hebdo shooting. The text in the image says, "He drew first." This statement is a play on words, suggesting that the person who drew the cartoons for Charlie Hebdo was the first to be killed in the attack.  The phrase "he drew first" is a literal interpretation of the sequence of events, but it's also a metaphorical statement that implies that the cartoonist's work was the cause of the attack. This is a controversial statement, as it can be interpreted as blaming the victim for their own death, which is a sensitive and potentially offensive topic.  The cartoon itself is a form of expression, and the artist has chosen to use it to make a statement about the events. However, the interpretation of the cartoon and the message it conveys can be subjective and may not align with everyone's perspective.  It's important to approach such sensitive topics with care and to be aware that different people may have different reactions to the same image or message.
The image you've provided appears to be a cover of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The text on the cover is in French, and it includes a cartoon depicting two figures in a close embrace with the caption "Enfin libre!" which translates to "Finally free!"  The cover seems to be making a statement about freedom, possibly in the context of political or social issues. However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine if the text contains anything that goes against common sense. The phrase "Enfin libre!" could be interpreted as a call for freedom in various contexts, such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, or freedom from oppression.  The cartoon itself is a form of satire, which is often used to critique societal issues or to make a point about current events. Satire is a form of humor that uses exaggeration, irony, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.

The second speech bubble says, "Plus il devient pointu..." which translates to "Plus he becomes pointy..."  The text in the image is a play on words, suggesting that the person holding the pencil is threatening to cut off the head of the person who is now pointy. This is a humorous exaggeration and not a literal threat. The cartoon is likely intended to be satirical or critical of a situation, but it's important to note that humor can be subjective and may not be understood or appreciated by everyone.  The text "Brilliant cartoons continue to emerge in wake of #Charliehebdo attack" suggests that the cartoon is a response to the Charlie Hebdo attack, which was a tragic event. The cartoon's content is not in line with common sense, as it uses a violent and exaggerated threat to make a point, which is not a typical or reasonable way to express disagreement or critique.
The text in the image appears to be a quote attributed to a mother of two young children who attend school near the site of the Charlie Hebdo attack. The quote reads: "They said: 'There was a murder, Mummy.' We had to explain the shootings near their school."  There is nothing inherently against common sense in the text itself. It is a statement about the mother's experience and the need to explain a tragic event to her children. However, the context of the quote, which includes the hashtag #JeSuisCharlie, suggests that the mother is expressing solidarity with the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attack.  The hashtag #JeSuisCharlie was widely used on social media as a symbol of solidarity and support for the victims and the principles of freedom of expression that Charlie Hebdo represented.

The words are "Bible," "Aux choristes," "Toutes les religions," and "Coran."  The phrase "Aux choristes" translates to "To the choirboys," which is a playful way of saying "To the choir." The phrase "Toutes les religions" means "All religions," and "Coran" refers to the holy book of Islam. The humor here seems to be a play on the idea of religious tolerance and the idea of different religious texts being treated as if they were musical scores, with the implication that all religions are equal and should be treated with the same respect as a choir would be.  The image also includes a caricature of a religious figure, which is a common form of satire used to critique religious figures or institutions.

It is always advisable to seek out reliable sources of news and information for a more comprehensive understanding of current events.

The text you've provided appears to be a statement about the radicalization of a terrorist, specifically in the context of the Iraq War and the Abu Ghraib torture scandal. The statement seems to suggest a causal link between these events and the radicalization of the individual in question.  Whether or not this statement is accurate or goes against common sense depends on the context and the evidence supporting it. It's important to note that the causes of radicalization are complex and multifaceted, and attributing it solely to the Iraq War and Abu Ghraib is a simplification.  The Iraq War and Abu Ghraib are significant events that have been linked to increased terrorism in various ways. The Iraq War, for instance, is often cited as a major factor in the rise of ISIS, which has been linked to numerous terrorist attacks. Similarly, the Abu Ghraib torture scandal is widely recognized as a significant factor in the recruitment of terrorists, as it was seen as a symbol of Western aggression and hypocrisy.

However, it is important to note that this phrase is a simplistic and oversimplified argument that does not take into account the complexities of gun control and the prevention of mass shootings.  The tweet is not based on factual information and is likely intended to be humorous or satirical, rather than a serious statement. It is not a statement of common sense, as it does not reflect the reality of gun control and its impact on crime rates.

It is not clear from the image alone what the specific context or reasoning behind this connection is. The text
The text in the image is a statement that reads, "The Earth without Art is just 'Eh'." This statement is a play on words, suggesting that without art, the Earth would be dull or uninteresting, as the word "Eh" is often used to express a lack of enthusiasm or interest. The statement is not factual and is meant to be a creative or humorous expression rather than a statement of fact.

The text "BREAKING: French far-right leader Le Pen calls for death penalty #CharlieHebdo" is a statement that appears to be a headline or a tweet. It is not a factual statement, but rather a representation of a news event or a social media post.  The statement is not inherently against common sense, as it is a factual report of an event or a statement made by a public figure. However, the context of the statement, such as the source of the information and the reliability of the news outlet or the person who posted the tweet, can influence whether the statement is considered reasonable or not.

The text argues that the JNU Left celebrated cartoons that depicted the Hindu goddess Durga as a prostitute, while simultaneously denouncing cartoons from Charlie Hebdo, which is a French satirical magazine known for its controversial and often offensive cartoons.  The text suggests that the JNU Left's stance is hypocritical because they are selectively outraged by the Charlie Hebdo cartoons, which are often seen as offensive to religious sensitivities, while they did not show the same level of outrage towards the cartoons that depicted Durga in a derogatory manner.  The text does not provide any information that goes against common sense.

However, it is important to note that the Quran does not contain any passages that promote violence or the killing of any individuals, regardless of their profession.  The statement is ironic because it is a response to the tragic events at Charlie Hebdo, where cartoonists were killed in an act of terrorism. The statement is not meant to be taken literally but rather to make a point about the misuse of religious texts to justify violence.  The cartoon itself is a form of satire, using humor to critique the actions of the terrorists and the misuse of religious texts. It is not meant to be taken as a literal statement about the Quran but rather as a commentary on the events that occurred.
The image depicts a cartoon character with a speech bubble that says, "Plus il devient pointu..." which translates to "The more he becomes pointy..." This phrase is a play on words, as "pointu" can mean both "pointy" and "stupid."

The humor in the image comes from the visual pun created by the pencil and the phrase "pointu."

The statement "17 journalists massacred by Israel in Gaza, 2014. Where were these 'freedom of speech' people then?" is a rhetorical question implying that the international community, which is often associated with the defense of freedom of speech, did not show the same level of support for journalists killed in Gaza as they did for the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attack.  The statement is not factually incorrect; it is a commentary on the perceived discrepancy in international response to the deaths of journalists in different contexts. However, it is important to note that the situation in Gaza is complex and multifaceted, and the international community's response to the conflict is influenced by a variety of factors, including political, humanitarian, and security considerations.

The statement suggests that if a Muslim on social media has not tweeted "#CharlieHebdo," they are an Islamist and an enemy.

However, the context of the image, which shows a person holding a copy of Charlie Hebdo, might suggest that the newspaper is continuing to publish despite the tragic events that occurred in 2015. The decision to continue publishing in the aftermath of such events is a complex issue that involves freedom of speech, the right to satire, and the need to respect the sensitivities of different communities.  The decision to continue publishing can be seen as a statement of defiance against those who would silence the press, but it can also be interpreted as insensitive or disrespectful to those who were affected by the events. The response to this decision is varied, with some people supporting the right to free speech and others arguing that the content of the newspaper is offensive and in poor taste.

The text is not meant to be taken literally and is not a statement of fact or a call to action.
The text "NATO calls Russia anti-terror ally after Paris attack" is not consistent with the image provided. The image shows a man standing in front of a backdrop with the European Union flag, not the NATO flag.

The cartoon is likely intended to be satirical, using humor to comment on the event and the values it represents.

However, the images provided do not show any individuals being targeted or arrested. Instead, they show police officers in riot gear, which is not typical for anti-terror operations. Additionally, the text "Anti-terror police close in on #CharlieHebdo suspects in tiny French village" is not consistent with the images, as the images do not depict a tiny French village.  The images show police officers in riot gear, which is not typical for anti-terror operations. Anti-terror operations usually involve specialized units trained to deal with terrorism, and they would not be seen in riot gear. The presence of riot gear suggests that the situation is not related to terrorism, but rather a public order disturbance or a protest.  Therefore, the text "Anti-terror police close in on #CharlieHebdo suspects in tiny French village" is not consistent with the images provided, and it goes against common sense.
The text in the image is a quote attributed to George R. R. Martin, which reads: "If you think religion is worth killing for, please start with yourself." This statement is a commentary on the idea that if someone believes a religion is so important that they are willing to kill for it, they should first examine their own beliefs and actions to ensure they align with the principles of that religion.  The statement does not go against common sense in the sense of being factually incorrect or illogical. It is a philosophical statement that encourages self-reflection and introspection. However, it may be considered controversial or sensitive due to the subject matter of religion and the act of killing.
The text in the image reads:  "yesterday today tomorrow"  This phrase is nonsensical and does not convey a clear message.

The text in the image appears to be a headline from a news source, which seems to be making a claim about the responsibility for a terrorist attack in Paris.

It is important to critically evaluate news sources and to verify information from multiple, credible sources before accepting it as fact.

The image you've provided is a cartoon by Chappatte from The New York Times, which is a form of satire. The cartoon depicts a man standing over a pile of rubble with a speech bubble that reads, "Without humor we are all dead." The text in the image is a statement by Chappatte, and it is not a factual statement but rather a philosophical or artistic expression.

The text "Who profits from killing Charlie?" is not part of the original statement "Je suis Charlie" and does not appear to be related to the Charlie Hebdo shooting or the image of candles. It seems to be an unrelated statement or question.  Without additional context, it's not possible to determine if this statement goes against common sense or not. It appears to be a separate statement that is not directly related to the image or the original "Je suis Charlie" slogan.
The text in the image reads "YO SOY CHARLIE," which translates to "I am Charlie" in English. This phrase is a reference to the Charlie Hebdo magazine, which was the target of a terrorist attack in January 2015. The phrase has been used as a symbol of solidarity and support for freedom of expression and the victims of the attack.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a clear and straightforward message of solidarity and support for the principles of freedom of expression and the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attack.
The text in the image appears to be a meme or a social media post that is making a statement about the media coverage of certain events. It references Anders Breivik, who is known for committing a mass shooting in Norway in 2011, and the hashtag #KillAllChristians, which is not a real hashtag and is likely meant to be a provocative statement.  The text suggests that the media did not focus on the fact that Breivik was a Christian when reporting on the event, which is a common criticism of media coverage of mass shootings. It implies that the media should have highlighted his religious affiliation, which is a controversial and sensitive topic.  The statement "Remember how the media made a big thing out of the fact that he was a Christian?" is a commentary on the perceived bias in media coverage, suggesting that the media should have emphasized his religious identity.  The text does not provide any factual information that goes against common sense. It is expressing an opinion about media coverage and the public's perception of it. However, it is important to note that the statement about the media's coverage of Breivik's religious affiliation is a subject of debate and can be seen as controversial due to the sensitive nature of the topic.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline in French, which translates to "This morning in France, anti-Muslim terrorists threw 2 or 3 grenades into a mosque No injuries."  The headline seems to be a straightforward report of an incident. However, the statement "No injuries" is somewhat unusual and could be considered against common sense, as one would expect that an explosion from grenades would cause some injuries, especially if the grenades were thrown into a building where people are present.  The absence of injuries in this case is either an oversight in the reporting or an indication that the grenades were not powerful enough to cause significant harm. It's also possible that the grenades were thrown in a way that minimized the risk of injury, such as being thrown away from the main entrance or during a time when the mosque was not crowded.  Without additional context or information, it's difficult to determine the exact circumstances of the incident.
The text appears to be a summary of information about the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo shooting in Paris, France. It lists several points that are generally consistent with what is known about the events and their aftermath. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense, as it seems to be a straightforward recounting of facts and events.
The text in the image appears to be a statement or a comment related to the Charlie Hebdo massacre, which was a tragic event in which several people were killed in a terrorist attack in France. The text seems to be discussing the response of Iran to the massacre, suggesting that Iran's condemnation of the event is not credible due to the situation of a man on death row for blogging.  The statement that "Iran condemns #CharlieHebdo massacre?! What about this man on death row... for blogging!" is a form of irony, as it implies that Iran's condemnation of the massacre is hypocritical or insincere because of the situation of the man on death row. The implication is that Iran's stance on freedom of expression is inconsistent with its actions in the case of the blogger.  However, the statement does not provide enough context to determine if it is factually accurate or if it is a form of satire or commentary. It is important to verify the accuracy of such statements before sharing them, as they can be misleading or inaccurate.
The text in the image states: "The Eiffel Tower went dark Thursday evening to honor victims of #CharlieHebdo attack."  This statement is consistent with common sense and is supported by the image, which shows the Eiffel Tower lit up at night. The fact that the Eiffel Tower is illuminated in the photo suggests that it was not darkened in the way the text describes. Therefore, the text does not go against common sense based on the image provided.
The image depicts a cartoon by Steve Bell, which appears to be a satirical commentary on the Charlie Hebdo attackers. The text "Steve Bell on the Charlie Hebdo attackers ‚Äì cartoon" suggests that the cartoon is a response to the tragic events that occurred in January 2015, when gunmen attacked the offices of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, killing 12 people.  The cartoon itself shows a figure in a balaclava holding a gun, with a group of people in the background who are depicted with exaggerated facial expressions, possibly representing the attackers. The exaggerated expressions and the fact that the figure in the balaclava is shooting at the group could be interpreted as a critique of the attackers' actions.  The text "3764-" and "@StaveBell 2015-09-13" likely refer to the artist's signature and the date when the cartoon was created or published.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The text is straightforward and provides context for the image.
The text in the image is a meme that uses humor to make a point about the misconception of terrorism being associated with a specific religion. The meme is trying to convey that the term "terrorist" should not be used to describe all individuals who follow a certain religion, as it is a misleading and inaccurate generalization.  The meme is not factually incorrect; it is a form of satire or commentary on the misuse of the term "terrorist" in the media and public discourse. It is important to note that the meme is not intended to be taken literally but rather to provoke thought and discussion about the complex and nuanced nature of terrorism and the need to avoid stereotypes and generalizations.
The text in the image is a commentary on the Charlie Hebdo attack and the concept of freedom of speech. It suggests that there is a double standard in the West when it comes to freedom of speech, implying that the West is hypocritical in its application of this principle.  The first panel shows a cartoonist drawing a cartoon of a Jewish figure, with the caption "It's Anti-Semitism!" This panel seems to be making a point about the sensitivity to depictions of religious figures, which is often a topic of debate.  The second panel shows the same cartoonist being attacked by a large fist labeled "The West," with the caption "It's Freedom of Speech!" This panel seems to be suggesting that the West is inconsistent in its application of freedom of speech, as it is often quick to condemn certain types of speech as offensive or hateful, while at the same time claiming to uphold the principle of freedom of speech.  The text in the image is a form of satire, using exaggerated visuals to make a point about a complex issue. It is not making a statement that goes against common sense, but rather critiquing the perceived inconsistency in the application of freedom of speech principles.
The text in the image is a meme that is intended to be humorous by playing on stereotypes. It shows two pictures of people with arrows pointing to them, with the text "In case you are confused" above the first picture and "This is a terrorist, this is a Muslim" below the second picture.  The meme is problematic because it associates terrorism with a specific religion, which is not accurate. Terrorism is a criminal act that can be committed by individuals of any religion or background. It is important to avoid making generalizations about any group of people based on their religion or ethnicity, as this can perpetuate stereotypes and discrimination.  The meme is also in poor taste, as it is making light of a serious issue, which is the tragic loss of life in the Charlie Hebdo shooting in France. It is not appropriate to use such a sensitive event for comedic effect.
The text you provided appears to be a statement attributed to Bill Maher. However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine the accuracy of the statement. It's important to note that attributing such a statement to Bill Maher without proper context can be misleading and potentially harmful, as it could be interpreted as a blanket statement about all Muslims.  It's crucial to approach such topics with sensitivity and to be aware of the potential for misinformation or misunderstanding. It's also important to consider the source of the statement and the context in which it was made.
The text in the image says "#JeSuisCharlie," which is a hashtag that was widely used on social media following the terrorist attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in January 2015. The hashtag is a show of solidarity and support for the victims and the principles of freedom of speech and expression.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The hashtag is a widely recognized symbol of solidarity and support for the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attack and for the principles of freedom of speech and expression. It is a message of unity and compassion in the face of violence and terrorism.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a social media post discussing the situation at Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) in Paris, France. The headline mentions "go-arounds," which refers to an aircraft circling the airport to lose altitude before landing. The text also mentions "unknown if weather related or any connection to #CharlieHebdo shooting 5 km from airport," which suggests that the situation at the airport might be related to the Charlie Hebdo shooting that occurred in Paris in January 2015.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The headline is providing information about a situation at an airport, and the text is speculating about the possible reasons for the go-arounds, including the possibility of a connection to a recent terrorist attack. The text is not making any claims that are obviously false or contradictory to common sense.
The text in the image reads, "SO WHO WANTS TO GET HIS CARTOON DONE?" This statement is a play on words, suggesting that the cartoonists are in high demand and are being asked to create cartoons for various people. The humor comes from the fact that the cartoonists are depicted as being so busy that they are not able to create cartoons for everyone who wants one. The phrase "ME... ME... ME..." is a common way to express that someone wants something done immediately, which in this context is a playful way of saying that the cartoonists are overwhelmed with requests.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a humorous take on the situation, suggesting that the cartoonists are very popular and in-demand.
The text in the image appears to be a statement expressing frustration with what the author perceives as a double standard in the way that Muslims are treated in comparison to others. The author is expressing their opinion that Muslims are subjected to a different standard of scrutiny and criticism than others, particularly in the context of the Charlie Hebdo tragedy.  The statement is not inherently against common sense, as it is a commentary on a perceived social issue. However, it is important to note that the text is a subjective opinion and may not reflect the views of all individuals, nor does it necessarily represent a factual statement. It is also worth noting that the text is part of a larger conversation about freedom of speech, religious tolerance, and the complexities of cultural and religious diversity.
The text in the image appears to be a tweet by Nigel Farage, a British politician, in which he expresses a viewpoint about the Charlie Hebdo shooting in France. The text states: "Charlie Hebdo: We ignored the threat from within our own societies."  The statement "we ignored the threat from within our own societies" is a subjective interpretation of the events leading up to the Charlie Hebdo attack. It suggests that there was a failure to recognize or address the potential for extremist violence within the society where the attack occurred.  Whether this statement goes against common sense depends on one's perspective. Some might argue that it is a reasonable observation given the context of the Charlie Hebdo attack and the broader issue of terrorism. Others might disagree, arguing that it oversimplifies the complexities of terrorism and the challenges of preventing such attacks.  In general, the statement is not inherently against common sense, but it is a statement that invites further discussion and analysis.
The text in the image is a meme that uses humor to make a point. It is not meant to be taken literally. The meme is playing on the idea that someone might be confused about the nature of the individuals in the image, which are actually police officers. The text labels one person as a "terrorist" and the other as a "Muslim," which is a misleading and offensive stereotype. The meme is not factual and is intended to be satirical or humorous, but it can be seen as insensitive and inappropriate.

The image you've provided appears to be a satirical cartoon from Charlie Hebdo, a French satirical magazine known for its provocative and often controversial content. The text in the image is in French, and it seems to be a play on words or a humorous commentary on a specific topic.  Without translating the entire text, it's difficult to determine if there's anything in the text that goes against common sense. However, the cartoon itself is a form of satire, which often uses exaggeration and humor to critique or comment on societal issues or events. Satire is a form of expression that is subjective and can be interpreted in various ways.  It's important to note that satire is not always intended to be taken literally and can be a form of social commentary. The context in which the cartoon was created and the intentions of the artist are also important factors in understanding the message.  If you're looking for something that goes against common sense, it would be more appropriate to look at the content of the cartoon itself, as satire often uses absurdity or exaggeration to make a point. However, without a full translation and understanding of the context, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer.
The image shows a person lying on the ground with a caption that reads, "In case you are confused. Check who's the terrorist and who's the #Muslim. #JeSuisCharlie #JeSuisAhmed." The text is a meme that is intended to be humorous by playing on the stereotype that all Muslims are terrorists.  The meme is problematic because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype that is not supported by facts. It is important to note that the vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and law-abiding citizens who do not support terrorism. The meme is also in poor taste, as it is making light of a serious issue and potentially causing offense to those who are affected by terrorism.

The text in the image is a meme that uses a humorous approach to differentiate between a terrorist and a Muslim. It suggests that a terrorist is someone who is not a Muslim, while a Muslim is someone who is not a terrorist. This is a simplistic and incorrect representation of the relationship between terrorism and religion.  In reality, terrorism is a political ideology and a tactic used by various groups for different reasons, and it is not exclusive to any particular religion. Similarly, being a Muslim does not inherently make someone a terrorist. The meme is likely intended to be satirical, but it can be misleading and offensive to some people. It is important to be mindful of the complexities of terrorism and the diversity of religious beliefs when discussing these topics.
The text in the image appears to be a social media post expressing solidarity with the victims of the Charlie Hebdo shooting and the Ahmed Merabet shooting, which occurred in Paris in January 2015.

The text in the image appears to be a tweet by a user named BDUTT, which seems to be making a controversial statement. The statement suggests that France's recognition of Palestine was the cause of the Charlie Hebdo attack, which is a false and inflammatory claim.  The Charlie Hebdo attack was a terrorist shooting that took place in Paris, France, in January 2015, where 12 people were killed, including several staff members of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The attack was carried out by two Islamist terrorists who were motivated by their opposition to the magazine's depiction of the Prophet Muhammad.  The statement in the tweet is not supported by any credible evidence and is a form of hate speech. It is not a factual statement and is likely intended to incite further conflict or to express a controversial opinion.  It is important to note that the recognition of Palestine by France is a separate issue from the Charlie Hebdo attack and should not be conflated with the events that led to the tragedy. The tweet is a poor attempt to justify the attack and is not based on factual information.

The text you provided appears to be a statement attributed to a radical cleric named Chaudry. The statement "Muslims don't believe in freedom of speech" is a generalization that may not accurately reflect the beliefs of all Muslims. It is important to note that Islam, like any other religion, is diverse and encompasses a wide range of beliefs and practices. Many Muslims do indeed support freedom of speech and the right to express opinions, even if they disagree with them.  The statement is also a misrepresentation of the concept of freedom of speech in Islam. While there are certainly restrictions on speech in Islamic law, these restrictions are generally aimed at protecting the rights of others and maintaining social order. They do not necessarily mean that Muslims do not believe in freedom of speech.  In summary, the statement attributed to Chaudry is a misleading generalization that does not accurately reflect the beliefs of all Muslims. It is important to approach such statements with a critical eye and to be aware of the diversity within the Muslim community.

The image itself is a meme that uses the phrase "Je suis" (I am) followed by the name "Raif Badawi," which is a reference to the individual who was flogged. The meme is often used to express solidarity with the individual and to draw attention to the situation.  The text and the meme together seem to be making a statement about the perceived contradiction between the condemnation of an act of terrorism and the punishment of an individual for expressing opinions. This could be seen as a commentary on the complexities of international relations and the balance between security and human rights.

It is not making any factual claims that are obviously false or contradictory to common sense.
The text in the image reads:  "...And that is why we decided to merge our religions into one and consequently abolish it."

The phrase is also commonly used by terrorists as a battle cry before committing acts of violence.  The text does not provide any information that goes against common sense. It appears to be a statement about the use of cartoons as a form of expression or commentary, which is a common practice in many countries. The cartoons themselves are a form of satire, which is a legitimate form of expression that uses humor or exaggeration to criticize or comment on social, political, or cultural issues.  It's important to note that the use of such a phrase in a cartoon can be controversial and may be seen as offensive or insensitive to some people, particularly those who associate the phrase with terrorism.

The statement is not against common sense, as it reflects a widely held belief among many Muslims that terrorism is a perversion of their faith and that Islam promotes peace, tolerance, and compassion. The hashtags #JeSuisCharlie and #NotInMyName are symbols of solidarity against terrorism and a rejection of violence in the name of religion.
The text in the image reads "Jesus Charlie," which is a phrase that has been associated with the Charlie Hebdo attacks in France. The phrase is a play on words, combining the name "Jesus" with the name "Charlie," which is a common nickname for Charles. The phrase is often used in a derogatory manner to express disbelief or disapproval, particularly in the context of the Charlie Hebdo attacks, where the phrase was used by the attackers to express their religious beliefs and motives.  The phrase "French fashion unites again terror:" is a statement that seems to be making a connection between fashion and terrorism, which is an unusual and potentially misleading statement. It suggests that fashion is somehow involved in or supportive of terrorism, which is not a common or logical association. This statement is likely intended to be provocative or to make a statement about the perceived influence of fashion on society, but it does not reflect common sense or accurate information.
The text "They wanted the people to crumble, instead they came together. #JeSuisCharlie" is a statement that seems to be a commentary on the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo shooting in Paris, France, in 2015.

The image depicts a cartoon with a caption that reads, "Are you scared? Ask him!" The cartoon shows a person holding a gun and pointing it at another person who is sitting at a drawing board. The person with the gun is wearing a mask and has a menacing expression.  The text "Sify cartoon" suggests that this is a cartoon from the Sify website, which is known for its satirical and often controversial content. The cartoon appears to be making a statement about fear and the power of intimidation.  The question "Are you scared? Ask him!" is a direct challenge to the person being threatened, implying that the person with the gun is not afraid to use it. This is a common theme in satire, where the cartoonist uses exaggeration and hyperbole to make a point about a serious issue.  The cartoon does not go against common sense in the sense that it is a form of satire and is intended to provoke thought and discussion about the topic of fear and intimidation. However, it is important to note that the depiction of violence and the use of a gun in a cartoon can be sensitive and may not be appropriate for all audiences.

There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense; it's a fictional scenario created for comedic effect. The cartoon is making a statement about the media's tendency to review their own work, which can be seen as a form of self-promotion or a lack of impartiality.
The image shows a meme with two arrows pointing to a person lying on the ground, with the text "In case you are confused. This is a terrorist. This is a Muslim." The meme is making a false equivalence between the person lying on the ground and the concept of terrorism, which is a serious crime and not a characteristic of a religion. The meme is also making a false equivalence between the person lying on the ground and the concept of Islam, which is a religion followed by millions of people around the world.  The meme is not based on common sense or factual information. It is a form of misinformation that can be harmful and offensive. It is important to be aware of the potential for misinformation and to avoid spreading it.
The text provided in the image is consistent with the common sense understanding of the situation.

The image depicts a humorous take on the Western Civilization Times newspaper, with a man reading it and reacting to the headlines. The headlines are exaggerated and satirical, suggesting a humorous or ironic commentary on the state of Western civilization. The text "OH, GREAT" is a common phrase used to express surprise or disbelief, which is fitting for the exaggerated headlines.  The text "OUR NEW FILM CRITIC" is a play on words, implying that the newspaper is now reviewing films, which is not a typical function of a newspaper. This is a humorous exaggeration, as newspapers do not typically review films.  The text "OUR NEW ART CRITIC" is similar, suggesting that the newspaper is now reviewing art, which is also not a typical function of a newspaper. This is another example of satire, suggesting that the newspaper is expanding its coverage to include art criticism.  The text "OUR NEW CRITIC" is a general statement that implies that the newspaper is now critiquing various aspects of culture, which is a common function of newspapers, but the exaggerated headlines suggest that this is done in a humorous or satirical manner.

The text in the image appears to be a news headline, which seems to be reporting on a significant event. However, the text is not entirely clear due to the image quality and the angle of the shot. The headline mentions "Several schools evacuated as police surround #CharlieHebdo shooting suspects," which suggests that there was a shooting incident related to Charlie Hebdo, a French satirical magazine, and that schools were evacuated as a precautionary measure.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The headline is reporting on a real event, and the use of hashtags (#CharlieHebdo) is a common way to follow and discuss news events on social media. The headline is likely to be accurate, as it is from a reputable news source.
The image shows a sign with a cartoon depicting a character with a speech bubble that reads, "100 coups de gr√¢ce pour les musulmans." This translates to "100 blows of grace for Muslims." The text on the sign is in French, and it appears to be a satirical or humorous statement, possibly in response to the Charlie Hebdo attack.  The sign is being held by a person, and the background suggests it might be nighttime. The text on the sign is not inherently against common sense; it is a form of satire or humor. However, it is important to note that humor is subjective, and what might be funny to one person could be offensive or in poor taste to another.  The Charlie Hebdo attack was a tragic event, and the media response was varied. Some media outlets focused on the attack itself and the victims, while others discussed the broader issues of terrorism, freedom of speech, and the role of satire in society. The sign in the image seems to be a personal response to the event, rather than a formal media statement.
The text in the image appears to be a humorous or satirical statement, as it suggests that Uderzo, the creator of the Asterix comic series, is coming out of retirement to create a comic strip about Charlie Hebdo, which is a French satirical magazine known for its provocative and often controversial content. The statement is likely meant to be a joke, as it implies that Uderzo, who is known for his family-friendly and non-controversial comics, would create a comic strip for a publication that is famous for its edgy and sometimes offensive humor.  The text does not provide any information that goes against common sense. It is a playful and exaggerated statement that is not meant to be taken literally.

The text in the image is a meme that uses a humorous format to make a point. It shows two arrows pointing to a person lying on the ground, with one arrow labeled "This is a terrorist" and the other labeled "This is a Muslim." The meme is intended to be satirical, suggesting that the person lying on the ground is being incorrectly identified as a terrorist due to their appearance, and that the person is actually a Muslim.  The meme is making a statement about the stereotyping and misidentification of individuals based on their appearance, which is a common concern in discussions about Islamophobia and the impact of media representation. It is not suggesting that all Muslims are terrorists, but rather highlighting the potential for misidentification and the harm that can result from it.  The text "Muslims are not terrorists #CharlieHebdo #prisedotage #JeSuisAhmed" is a hashtag that is often used to express solidarity with the victims of the Charlie Hebdo shooting in France and to condemn the act of terrorism. The hashtag also references the term "prisedotage," which is a term used to describe the act of staging a crime to make it appear as if it was committed by a different group than the actual perpetrators.  The meme is not making a statement that goes against common sense. It
The text in the image appears to be a humorous or satirical statement, as it is attributed to Uderzo, who is known for creating the Asterix comic series. The text says, "Moi aussi je suis un Charlie," which translates to "Me too, I am a Charlie." This phrase is a reference to the Charlie Hebdo magazine, which was the target of a terrorist attack in 2015.  The statement is likely meant to be a show of solidarity with the magazine and its values, which include freedom of expression and satire. However, it is important to note that the text is a fictional creation and not a real statement by Uderzo. The image itself is a piece of artwork that seems to be inspired by the Asterix series, and the text is added to create a connection between the character and the magazine.  The text does not go against common sense in the sense of being factually incorrect or illogical. It is a form of artistic expression that uses humor and satire to convey a message. However, it is sensitive in nature due to the tragic events associated with Charlie Hebdo.
The text in the image is a meme that uses a humorous approach to differentiate between a terrorist and a Muslim. It suggests that a terrorist is someone who is not a Muslim, while a Muslim is someone who is not a terrorist. This is a simplistic and incorrect representation of the relationship between terrorism and religion.  In reality, terrorism is a political ideology and a tactic used by various groups for different reasons, and it is not exclusive to any particular religion. Similarly, being a Muslim does not inherently make someone a terrorist. The meme is likely intended to be satirical, but it can be misleading and offensive to some people. It is important to be mindful of the complexities of terrorism and the diversity of religious beliefs when discussing these topics.

The text "YO SOY CHARLIE" is a play on words as well, combining the French phrase "Je suis Charlie" with the Spanish phrase "Yo soy Charlie," which translates to "I am Charlie" in English.

The cartoon is not making a statement that goes against common sense but rather using satire to critique a situation that is considered absurd or ironic.

The meme is controversial because it plays on stereotypes and can be seen as offensive to some people. It is important to note that the text is not a factual statement but rather a form of satire or humor. It is not a reflection of reality or a statement about all Muslims.

It's important to approach such content with an understanding of the context and the potential for it to be interpreted in different ways by different people.

The presence of military vehicles in a civilian setting during a terrorist attack could be seen as a response to the threat posed by the terrorists, but it is not a typical response to such an incident. It is possible that the military was called in to assist with the situation, but it is not a common practice to deploy military vehicles in urban areas during a terrorist attack.

The text does not seem to go against common sense in the context of the situation it is describing. It is a commentary on a specific event and the actions of law enforcement in response to public unrest. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness and appropriateness of using dogs in law enforcement situations can be a topic of debate, with some arguing that it is a necessary tool for maintaining public safety and others questioning the necessity and potential for harm.
The text on the sign reads: "Stop police from killing people." This statement is not inherently against common sense, as it is a call for an end to police violence and the killing of civilians. However, it is important to note that the context of the sign, which appears to be a protest or demonstration, may be interpreted differently by different individuals based on their perspectives and experiences. Some may view it as a legitimate expression of concern about police conduct, while others may see it as an attack on law enforcement. The interpretation of the text can be influenced by a variety of factors, including personal beliefs, political views, and the specific circumstances surrounding the event or situation that led to the creation of the sign.
The text in the image appears to be a commentary or a comparison between two events, which are the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the standoff between the Bundy family and federal agents in Nevada. The text seems to be making a statement about the perceived differences in the treatment of these two situations by law enforcement.  The statement "Black jaywalking teen shot & killed by cops. White trespassing rancher's militia aim guns at cops." is a simplification of complex events and is likely intended to provoke thought or discussion about racial disparities in law enforcement and the perception of the use of force.  However, the statement is not factually accurate. The shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson was not a case of jaywalking; he was walking in the street when he was confronted by a police officer. The events in Nevada involved a standoff between federal agents and a group of armed individuals, but it is not accurate to describe the individuals as a "white trespassing rancher's militia." The individuals involved in the Nevada standoff were a diverse group of people, and it is not appropriate to label them based on their race or the color of their ranch.  The text is also likely to be controversial and could be seen as inflammatory or divisive, as it seems to be making a statement about racial bias in law enforcement without providing a nu
The text in the image appears to be a meme or a humorous statement rather than a factual one. It suggests that officers in Rialto, California, are now required to wear video cameras while on duty, and that this has led to a significant drop in the use of force by officers. The meme implies that the presence of cameras has caused a dramatic reduction in the number of complaints against the police.  While the text is likely intended to be humorous, it does not provide any actual evidence or data to support the claim that the use of video cameras has led to a 60% drop in the use of force by officers. It's important to note that the effectiveness of such measures would depend on various factors, including the specific policies and training of the police force, the nature of the incidents, and the community's perception of the police.  The text also includes a hashtag that references the events in Ferguson, Missouri, which were related to police-community relations and the use of force by law enforcement. The meme seems to be playing on the idea that the use of video cameras could help prevent incidents similar to those in Ferguson.  In summary, while the text is likely meant to be humorous, it does not provide any concrete evidence to support the claims made about the impact of video cameras on police behavior.
The text in the image appears to be a meme or a piece of satire, and it contains a statement that is not based on factual information. It suggests that officers in Rialto, California, are now required to wear video cameras while on duty, which is not accurate. The statement is likely intended to be humorous or to make a point about police accountability, but it is not reflective of the actual situation in Rialto.  The statement "In one year, use of force has dropped 60% & complaints have dropped by 88%" is a factual statement, indicating that the implementation of body cameras has led to a decrease in the use of force by officers and a decrease in complaints against them. This is a common-sense approach to improving police-community relations and increasing transparency.  The rest of the text is a call to action, suggesting that the public should demand that all police officers wear cameras. This is a common sentiment in discussions about police accountability and the use of body cameras as a tool to prevent misconduct and improve public trust in law enforcement.  Overall, the text contains a mix of factual information and satire, with the main message being a call for increased police accountability through the use of body cameras.
The text in the image appears to be a series of statements about the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The statements are presented in a way that seems to be critical of the police and the media coverage of the event. The text includes a call to action, suggesting that the reader should retweet or screenshot the message to spread the word about the need for justice.  The statements themselves are not inherently against common sense. They express a desire for justice and the right to bear arms, which are topics of public discourse and are within the realm of common sense. However, the context in which these statements are presented, along with the call to action, might be interpreted as an attempt to influence public opinion or to encourage a specific response to the event.  It's important to note that the accuracy of the statements and the context in which they are presented can vary widely, and it's always a good idea to verify information from multiple sources before sharing it.
The text "Protestors have blocked West Florissant, a major street in St. Louis County. #Ferguson" accurately describes the situation depicted in the image. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The image shows a large group of people gathered on a street, with some individuals standing in the middle of the road, which is a common occurrence during protests or demonstrations. The presence of multiple cars and a McDonald's sign in the background indicates that this is a public area, and the protestors have indeed blocked the street.
The text "#Ferguson #MikeBrown protests" is a reference to the protests that took place in Ferguson, Missouri, following the shooting of Michael Brown.

The image captures a moment of peaceful demonstration, which is a common practice in many countries.
The text in the image is a meme that uses a series of photos to make a point about the concept of peace signs and gang signs. The meme is intended to be humorous and is not meant to be taken literally. It is not making a statement about race or the events in Ferguson, Missouri, as it is not related to those topics. The text is simply a play on the idea that peace signs and gang signs are similar in appearance but have different meanings. The meme is not making a statement about reality, as it is a piece of internet humor and not a serious commentary on current events or social issues.

The text on the sign in the image reads: "STAND UP OR STAND DOWN FUCK THE POLICE!!!"  The statement "FUCK THE POLICE!!!" is a controversial and offensive message that goes against common sense and is considered inappropriate and disrespectful. It is not a constructive or respectful way to express dissent or disagreement with law enforcement.
The text in the image does not provide any information that goes against common sense.

The text in the image appears to be a tweet or a social media post that is commenting on a situation in Ferguson, Missouri, where Michael Brown was killed. The text is not directly against common sense, but it is expressing a viewpoint or opinion about the event.  The text reads: "Happening now in #Ferguson where #MikeBrown was killed."  This statement is factual and does not go against common sense. It is simply reporting the location and the event that took place there.  However, if the context of the image is meant to imply that the event is still happening, that would be incorrect. The event in question took place in 2014, and while there may be ongoing discussions, protests, or commemorations related to the event, the actual event itself is not happening now.  If the text is meant to convey a different message or if there is additional context that is not visible in the image, it could potentially be against common sense or misleading. Without additional information, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer.
The text in the image appears to be a commentary on the contrast between the police response in Ferguson, Missouri, and the National Guard's response to the 1967 Newark riots. The text suggests that the police in Ferguson are more militarized than the actual National Guard.  The statement is not inherently against common sense, as it is based on the visual comparison of the images provided. However, it is important to note that the context of the situation and the specific circumstances surrounding the events in Ferguson and Newark are not fully captured by the images alone. The text is making a comparison between the two situations, which may or may not be accurate depending on the specific details of each event.  It is also worth noting that the comparison is subjective and based on the observer's interpretation of the images. Different individuals might have different opinions on the level of militarization in each situation.

The text "PHOTOS:: #Ferguson, Missouri, looks like a war zone" is a subjective statement and does not necessarily go against common sense. It is an interpretation of the images provided, which show police officers in a vehicle with their lights on, and a person taking a photograph of the scene. The term "war zone" is often used to describe a situation that appears chaotic or dangerous, and it is possible that the person who wrote the text was trying to convey a sense of urgency or conflict.  However, it is important to note that the situation in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 was indeed a time of civil unrest and tension, with protests and demonstrations taking place after the shooting of Michael Brown. The presence of law enforcement and the use of tear gas and other crowd control measures were part of the response to these events.  In general, the text is not inherently against common sense, but it is a subjective interpretation of the images and the situation in Ferguson at the time.
The text "The protestors have started marching into a neighborhood. Police still standing here. #Ferguson #MichaelBrown" does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It describes a situation where a group of people is marching, and law enforcement is present to maintain order. This is a typical scenario during a protest or demonstration, and it is not unusual for police to be present to ensure public safety and to facilitate the right to protest peacefully.
The text in the image appears to be a statement about the context of the image, which is a screenshot from a news broadcast showing a scene with law enforcement officers and a person who seems to be in distress or conflict.

The text in the image appears to be a threat from the hacking group Anonymous, which is known for its activities in support of various causes, including social justice and internet freedom. The statement "Anonymous hacking group threatens the #Ferguson police in wake of the murder of Mike Brown" suggests that the group is taking action in response to the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.  The statement itself does not go against common sense. It is a clear and direct message from the group, indicating their intention to engage in hacking activities against the Ferguson police. However, it is important to note that hacking is illegal and can have serious consequences. Additionally, the statement does not provide any specific details about the nature of the threat or the methods that Anonymous plans to use.  It is also worth noting that the image itself is a humorous take on the situation, with two people wearing Guy Fawkes masks, which are often associated with Anonymous, standing in front of a bank. The masks are a symbol of the group's anonymity and their opposition to authority and corruption.
The text you provided appears to be a statement about the situation in Ferguson, Missouri, following the shooting of Michael Brown. The statement seems to be making a comparison between the police in Ferguson and an occupying army, which is a hyperbolic and subjective statement.  The statement is not factually accurate and can be considered misleading. It is not common sense to describe law enforcement officers as an "occupying army" in a general sense, as they are not typically involved in military occupation of a territory. The statement is likely intended to convey a sense of tension or conflict between the police and the community, but it does not accurately describe the situation.  It is important to note that the situation in Ferguson was complex and involved a range of issues, including racial tensions, economic disparities, and law enforcement practices. It is not appropriate to make sweeping generalizations about the situation without a full understanding of the context and events that led to the unrest.

The text in the image reads, "We want a murder charge!!!" This statement is unusual because it is not common for people to publicly advocate for a murder charge, especially in a peaceful demonstration context. Typically, in such situations, protesters would call for justice, accountability, or a thorough investigation, but not specifically for a murder charge. The statement seems to be a call for the most severe legal consequence, which might not align with the general sentiment of seeking justice and fairness in the legal system.
The text "Peaceful youth demonstration at Greater St. Mark Church #ferguson" is consistent with the image and the context of the situation.

The context of the image, showing a group of people protesting, supports the message of the text.  However, it's important to note that the events in Ferguson were complex and involved multiple factors, including the actions of the police officer and the circumstances leading up to the shooting.

It seems to be a straightforward statement about a public figure and the context in which their name is being discussed.
The text in the image is a meme that is meant to be humorous or satirical. It is not a factual statement and is not meant to be taken literally. The meme is playing on the idea that conservatives are being unfairly labeled as terrorists, and it uses a dramatic image of a building that has been severely damaged, presumably from a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, to make a point.  The text itself is a play on words, suggesting that conservatives are being accused of stealing, looting, and damaging property, which is an exaggeration and not a reflection of reality. The meme is not making a factual statement about conservatives, but rather using hyperbole and irony to make a point about the perception of conservatives in certain contexts.  It is important to note that the meme is not based on any actual events or news stories, and it is not intended to be a serious analysis of the actions of conservatives or anyone else. It is simply a piece of internet humor that is meant to be shared on social media for entertainment purposes.

It also states that there is no smash-smash, which could be a reference to the unrest that occurred in Ferguson following the shooting of Michael Brown.  The statement "Quiet where I am" seems to be a contrast to the situation in Ferguson, which was known for its unrest and protests. The rest of the text seems to be a factual observation of the scene at the time the photo was taken.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward description of a scene, and the use of hashtags (#Ferguson) is a common way to reference a specific event or location on social media.
The image you've provided appears to be a screenshot from a news segment discussing the demographics of the Ferguson Police Department.

The text in the image appears to be a tweet that is expressing a controversial opinion. It suggests that the shooting of a police officer by a criminal was a result of the police officer's actions, implying that the officer brought the situation upon themselves.

The text does not provide any context or information that would indicate that this is actually Ferguson, Missouri, or that it is related to the events that occurred there.  The image shows a group of military personnel on top of a military vehicle, with smoke in the background. The presence of military personnel and vehicles in a civilian setting is not a common occurrence, and it is not clear why they are there. The text does not provide any additional information that would help to clarify the situation.  Therefore, the text in the image does not go against common sense, but the image itself does not accurately represent the location or context described by the text.
The text in the image reads, "What's wrong, mom? I'm only going to the store for snacks." This statement is not inherently against common sense.

It mentions that there are high-powered rifles trained on protesters, which is a factual observation of the image. However, without additional context, it's not clear what the situation is or what the implications of this observation are.  If you're asking about the image itself, it appears to show a group of law enforcement officers in riot gear, some of whom are holding guns. The presence of high-powered rifles suggests that the situation is being handled with a significant level of force, which might be considered unusual or concerning by some.  If you're asking about the text in relation to common sense, it's not clear what you mean by "common sense." Common sense can vary greatly among individuals and cultures, and what might be considered common sense to one person might not be to another. If you're referring to a specific aspect of the text or the image that you believe goes against common sense, please provide more details or clarify your question.

The text in the comic strip includes phrases like "No offense, but in my honest opinion," "SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
The text in the image appears to be a protestor's statement during a demonstration, which is a common occurrence during protests. The statement "Is this the Gaza Strip you bombin'" is a rhetorical question, likely intended to draw attention to the perceived injustice of the situation in Ferguson, Missouri, and to compare the situation there to the ongoing conflict in the Gaza Strip.  The statement is not inherently against common sense, as it is a form of expression that is typical in public demonstrations. However, the context of the protest and the specific circumstances surrounding the event are not provided in the image, so it's not possible to determine if the statement is factually accurate or if it is being used to make a broader political statement.  It's important to note that the image is a still from a video, and without additional context, it's difficult to fully understand the situation or the intentions of the protestors.
The text in the image appears to be a commentary on the contrast between the police response in Ferguson, Missouri, and the National Guard's response to the 1967 Newark riots. The text suggests that the police in Ferguson are more militarized than the actual National Guard.  The statement is not inherently against common sense, as it is based on the visual comparison of the images provided. However, it is important to note that the context of the situation and the specific circumstances surrounding the events in Ferguson and Newark are not fully captured by the images alone. The text is making a comparison between the two situations, which may or may not be accurate depending on the specific details of each event.

Different individuals might have different opinions on the level of militarization in each situation.
The text in the image is a warning about the potential presence of violent street gangs in Ferguson, Missouri, and it includes a description of what a gang member might look like. The text is a general warning and does not provide specific information about any particular gang or individual.  The image itself is a cartoon illustration of a police officer, which is not a typical representation of a gang member. The cartoon is stylized and does not accurately depict the appearance of a real gang member.  The text does not go against common sense in the sense that it is providing information about a potential safety concern.

The statement "high powered rifles trained on protesters" could be interpreted as a potential violation of common sense, as it suggests that law enforcement is using excessive force or engaging in a confrontational manner with peaceful protesters. This could be seen as a concern for public safety and civil rights.  However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine the accuracy of the tweet or the specific circumstances surrounding the situation in Ferguson. It's important to consider the broader context of the events and the actions of all parties involved.
The text "PHOTOS:: #Ferguson, Missouri, looks like a war zone" is a subjective statement and does not necessarily go against common sense. It is an interpretation of the images provided, which show police officers in a vehicle with their lights on, and a person taking a photograph of the scene. The term "war zone" is often used to describe a situation that appears chaotic or dangerous, and it is possible that the person who wrote the text was trying to convey a sense of urgency or conflict.  However, it is important to note that the situation in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 was indeed a time of civil unrest and tension, with protests and demonstrations taking place after the shooting of Michael Brown.

The text in the image reads: "RIOT POLICE WEAR MORE ARMOR THAN SOLDIERS IN AFGHAN."  The statement is factually incorrect. It is not accurate to say that riot police wear more armor than soldiers in Afghanistan. Soldiers in Afghanistan are typically equipped with body armor and helmets, which are designed to protect against ballistic threats, including bullets and shrapnel. Riot police, on the other hand, are generally equipped with helmets, face shields, and padded clothing to protect against blunt force trauma, such as being hit with a baton or a projectile.  The text is likely intended to be a provocative statement, possibly suggesting a comparison between the perceived level of threat faced by riot police and the actual level of threat faced by soldiers in a combat zone. However, it is important to note that the statement is not based on factual information and is likely intended to be a hyperbolic or exaggerated claim.

The text does not contain anything that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward statement about the historical context of the images and the broader social and political issues they may represent.
The text in the image is a meme that plays on the idea of historical events being mistaken for current events. It suggests that a photo of a police officer and a dog could be mistaken for a scene from Birmingham, Alabama in 1963, which is a reference to the civil rights movement and the events that took place there.  The meme is meant to be humorous by implying that the situation in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014 is so similar to the events in Birmingham that it could be confused with the past.

The text in the image suggests that the individuals in the photo are cleaning up after a riot, which is a positive action. However, the text also includes the hashtag "#Ferguson," which is associated with the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, following the shooting of Michael Brown. The hashtag implies that the individuals in the photo are involved in the aftermath of that event.  The statement "This is what they aren't showing you on the media" implies that the media is not showing the positive actions taken by individuals in the aftermath of the riots.

The text suggests that the person who posted it believes that there are only two possible reactions to the event: being furious about it or protecting one's entitlement.

It implies that there is a direct equivalence between the events in Ferguson and the Bundy Ranch standoff, which is a contentious issue.  The text is likely to be seen as inflammatory and divisive, as it oversimplifies complex issues and implies that anyone who does not agree with the author's perspective is either furious or protecting their entitlement. This kind of statement is not based on common sense and is more likely to be seen as a provocative statement meant to stir up emotions rather than promote a thoughtful discussion.
The text in the image says, "DON'T SHOOT!!" which is a direct command to not use a firearm. This is a common sense message, as shooting is generally considered to be a dangerous and potentially lethal action. The text is consistent with common sense and does not go against it.

It describes a person throwing tear gas back at the police, which is an unusual and potentially dangerous action.

The text in the image appears to be a meme or a humorous commentary on a situation. It reads:  "BIRMINGHAM, AL 1963?

The humor seems to be derived from the juxtaposition of the two events, implying that the situation in Ferguson is reminiscent of the civil rights movement in Birmingham.  However, the text is not factually accurate. Birmingham, Alabama, was indeed a significant location for civil rights protests in the 1960s, but Ferguson, Missouri, is not. The events in Ferguson in 2014 were not related to the civil rights movement in Birmingham. The meme is likely intended to be satirical or to make a statement about the perceived similarities between the two situations, but it is not a factual representation of history.

However, the context in which the sign is displayed, at a memorial for Michael Brown, suggests that the sign is specifically addressing the situation in Ferguson, Missouri, where there were reports of police using tear gas, armored vehicles, and trained dogs during protests following Brown's death.  In this context, the statement is a response to the perceived overuse of force by law enforcement in Ferguson, and it is not against common sense. It is a call for accountability and reform in law enforcement practices.
The text in the image is a meme that uses a humorous tone to express a political or social commentary. It reads: "And I'm proud to be an American, where at least I know I'm free." The meme is making a statement about the militarization of the police force in the United States, which has been a topic of concern for many people.  The text itself does not go against common sense.

However, the specific circumstances and the appropriateness of such measures are subject to ongoing debate and discussion.
The text in the image suggests that a man is throwing a tear gas canister back at police in Ferguson.

It suggests that there is a double standard where certain groups are held to different standards of behavior.  The text also includes a quote from Sheriff Clarke that says, "White liberal social policies have become the new racism in America."

The text you provided seems to be a description of a situation that is consistent with what has been reported in the media about protests and law enforcement in Ferguson, Missouri. It does not contain anything that goes against common sense. The text accurately describes a scene where a group of people is protesting, and there are police officers present, possibly facing off against the protesters. The presence of a police vehicle and a protester holding a sign are also mentioned, which are typical elements of such a scene.
The text in the image appears to be a commentary on the contrasting responses of law enforcement to different situations. It suggests that a SWAT team was deployed to a location in Texas, but not to another location, which is likely a reference to the events in Ferguson, Missouri, and the Bundy Ranch standoff in Nevada.  The text does not contain anything that goes against common sense. It is a statement that seems to be making a point about the perceived inconsistency in law enforcement's actions. However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine the accuracy of the statement. It's important to note that the text is a commentary and not a factual statement.
The text you provided seems to be a tweet from a user named "BmoreConetta" that mentions a SWAT truck in Ferguson, Missouri, with a gun pointing straight at protesters. The tweet is referencing a situation that occurred in Ferguson in 2014, where there were protests following the shooting of Michael Brown.  The statement "gun pointing straight at protesters" is a subjective interpretation of the image and may not accurately describe the situation. It is important to note that the image itself does not provide enough context to determine the exact nature of the situation or the intentions of the law enforcement officers.  In general, it is not common sense to point a gun directly at a group of unarmed people who are peacefully protesting. However, in situations involving law enforcement and public safety, there may be circumstances where a gun is pointed in a direction that could be perceived as directly at protesters. This could be due to the need to maintain order, protect property, or ensure the safety of the officers and the public.  It is crucial to consider the context of the situation and the actions of all parties involved when interpreting such images and news texts.
The text "Press has been corralled in with peaceful demonstrators in #ferguson" suggests that the media is being kept together with the protesters, which is a common practice during large public gatherings to ensure the safety of both the media and the public. This is not necessarily against common sense, as it is a standard procedure to maintain order and prevent conflicts between different groups during such events.
The text in the image appears to be a tweet that references the events at Tiananmen Square, which is a significant historical event. The tweet seems to be comparing the situation in Ferguson, Missouri, to the events at Tiananmen Square, suggesting a level of military presence and police action that is reminiscent of the Chinese government's response to the Tiananmen Square protests.  The tweet is making a comparison between the two situations, which is a form of commentary or analysis. It is not inherently against common sense, as it is a statement of observation and comparison. However, the tweet is likely to be controversial due to the sensitive nature of the events it references and the potential for misunderstanding or misinterpretation.  It's important to note that the situation in Ferguson was a local law enforcement response to civil unrest, and the comparison to Tiananmen Square is a commentary on the perceived severity of the police response. The tweet is not making a literal statement about the events in Ferguson, but rather drawing a parallel between the two situations.
The text in the image is a play on words, referencing the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. It says, "I have no gun. But my phone is fully charged. #DONTSHOOT #Ferguson #HANDSUP #MikeBrown."  The humor in this text comes from the fact that the person is saying they don't have a gun, which is a common plea for not being shot, but then humorously suggests that their phone is fully charged, which is not a reason to not be shot. The text is using the hashtag #DONTSHOOT, which is a reference to the protests and calls for justice that followed the shooting of Michael Brown.  The text is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a satirical commentary on the situation. It is not going against common sense in the literal sense, but it is using irony and humor to make a statement about the situation.
The text in the image suggests a narrative that the situation depicted in the photo is a war between oppressors and the oppressed, specifically referencing the events in Ferguson, Missouri, and the death of Michael Brown. However, it is important to note that the image shows a law enforcement vehicle with officers on top, and the context of the situation is not clear from the image alone.  The statement "You guess photo of war? Yes, you are right. This is a war between oppressor & oppressed" is a subjective interpretation of the image and the events it represents. It is not a factual statement based on the image alone. The situation in Ferguson was a complex and highly charged event that involved law enforcement, protests, and community unrest. It is not accurate to describe it as a war without further context and information.  The text also includes the hashtag "#Ferguson" and "#MikeBrown," which were widely used during the events in Ferguson to express solidarity and support for the cause of the protests. These hashtags were used to raise awareness about the situation and to advocate for change.  In summary, while the text in the image expresses a strong opinion about the situation, it is not a factual statement based on the image alone. The events in Ferguson were a complex and highly charged situation that involved law enforcement, protests, and
The text in the image appears to be a tweet by Baltimore County Police Commissioner John W. Conetta, which reads: "Just as the Founding Fathers intended. RT @BmoreConetta: Current situation in #ferguson."  The tweet seems to be a commentary on the situation in Ferguson, Missouri, which was a site of significant civil unrest following the shooting of Michael Brown by a police officer. The tweet suggests that the police response is in line with the principles of the Founding Fathers, which is a subjective interpretation of the situation.  The tweet does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It is a statement of opinion by the commissioner, and while it may be debatable whether the police response aligns with the intentions of the Founding Fathers, it is not a statement that defies common sense.
The text in the image reads: "Downtown Kandahar, Afghanistan, I think. Or #Ferguson, Mo. Someone help with location."  This statement is not consistent with common sense because it suggests that the location of the image is either Kandahar, Afghanistan, or Ferguson, Missouri, which are two very different places. Kandahar is a city in southern Afghanistan, while Ferguson is a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri, in the United States.  The image shows a police vehicle with officers on top, which is not typical for either of these locations. Kandahar is a war zone and would not have a police force in the same way that Ferguson, Missouri, would. The presence of a police vehicle with officers on top in a war zone would be highly unusual and would likely be a staged or misleading scenario.  The statement is likely meant to be humorous or satirical, as it juxtaposes two very different locations and situations. However, it is not a statement that aligns with common sense or reality.

It accurately describes a situation where law enforcement is enforcing an order to disperse a crowd, which is a standard procedure in situations where public safety is a concern. The text does not contain any information that would be considered unusual or counterintuitive.
The text in the image appears to be a social media post from a person who has found an alternative route to a QT gas station in Ferguson, Missouri. The post mentions that the main roads are blocked off, which is a common occurrence during protests or other large-scale events.

The text in the image appears to be a statement about a situation in Ferguson, Missouri. It suggests that snipers with rifles are aiming at unarmed American citizens. This statement is highly unusual and goes against common sense, as it implies a level of violence and aggression that is not typical in law enforcement operations, especially in a peaceful protest or demonstration.  The presence of snipers with rifles in a situation like this would be highly unusual and would likely be considered a violation of civil rights and a threat to public safety. It is important to note that the text in the image is a statement and not a factual report, and it is not clear if the situation described in the text is accurate or if it is an exaggeration or a misinterpretation of events.  In general, it is not common for law enforcement to use snipers with rifles in situations where citizens are unarmed and engaging in peaceful protests. The use of such tactics would be highly controversial and would likely be met with strong public opposition.
The text provided in the image seems to be a description of a protest or demonstration, which is a common form of expression and activism. It is not inherently against common sense to express one's views or to gather in public spaces to advocate for change. However, the context of the protest, such as the location and the specific cause, can be subject to interpretation and may involve complex social and political issues.  The text mentions "justice for #mikebrown," which refers to the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed African American teenager who was shot by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. The event sparked widespread protests and discussions about police brutality and racial injustice.  The presence of police in the vicinity of the protest is not unusual, as law enforcement is often present to maintain order and ensure public safety. The fact that the kids are dancing or chanting in front of a QuikTrip store suggests that they are exercising their right to free speech in a public space, which is a fundamental aspect of democratic societies.  Without additional context, it is not possible to determine if there is anything in the text that goes against common sense. The text appears to be a straightforward description of an event, and the actions of the individuals in the image are consistent with the right to peaceful assembly and expression.
The text in the image appears to be a tweet or a social media post that describes a situation in Ferguson, Missouri, where law enforcement is using armored vehicles and riot gear to try to disperse a crowd of demonstrators.

It accurately describes a situation that has been widely reported in the media. The presence of armored vehicles and riot gear is a common tactic used by law enforcement to maintain order during large public gatherings or protests. The fact that the police are having difficulty clearing the area could be seen as a challenge to their authority, but it is not an unusual occurrence in such situations.

It is a factual description of an event that occurred in a public place. The presence of SWAT police in a McDonald's is not a typical occurrence, but it is not inherently illogical or against common sense. The request for identification from journalists is also not unusual, as law enforcement may need to verify the identities of individuals in certain situations.  However, it is important to note that the context of the event, including the reasons for the police presence and the nature of the identification request, would be crucial in determining whether the actions described are appropriate or not.
The text in the image appears to be a tweet from an account called "YourAnonNews," which is known for its association with the Anonymous movement. The tweet suggests that SWAT police have entered a McDonald's restaurant in Ferguson and are asking journalists for identification.  The statement "SWAT police just entered a McDonald's in #Ferguson and started asking journalists for ID" is not inherently against common sense. However, the context of the situation is not provided in the image, and the tweet itself is from an account that is often associated with activism and social commentary.  The presence of SWAT police in a McDonald's restaurant is not a common occurrence, and it could be interpreted as a response to a specific incident or situation. The fact that journalists are being asked for identification could be seen as a potential violation of press freedom, which is a principle that many people consider important.  Without additional context, it's difficult to determine the accuracy of the tweet or the circumstances surrounding the event. However, the tweet does raise questions about the balance between law enforcement's duties to maintain public safety and the rights of journalists to report on events without interference.

It's crucial to consider the full context of the situation to understand the implications of the SWAT team's presence and actions.
The text in the image appears to be a protest sign, and it reads:  "OFFICERS COME OUT WITH YOUR MILITARY GEAR AND SHOOT US ALL"  This statement goes against common sense because it advocates for violence and the use of military force against law enforcement officers. It is a call for extreme action that is not a constructive or peaceful way to address grievances or disagreements. Such a statement is likely to be considered inflammatory and could be seen as promoting harm or conflict.
The text "Cops have changed since I was a kid #Ferguson #photo" is a statement that seems to be expressing a personal opinion or observation about the changes in law enforcement over time, possibly in response to events like the Ferguson protests.

The text in the image appears to be a comparison between the image of the person with smoke and the image of the person with fire. The text suggests that the person with smoke is reminiscent of the West Bank, which is a geographical area that is part of the Palestinian territories.  The comparison seems to be a commentary on the situation in the West Bank, possibly implying that the situation there is as chaotic or intense as the scene depicted in the image. However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine the accuracy or appropriateness of this comparison.  The text itself does not go against common sense, as it is a straightforward statement. However, the comparison of the two images could be seen as a subjective interpretation of the situation in the West Bank, which might not align with everyone's perspective or understanding of the region.
The text in the image appears to be a social media post or a caption for a photo, and it seems to be describing a scene that is unusual or unexpected. The statement "The streets of #Ferguson look a little different tonight" suggests that the location is Ferguson, Missouri, which is known for its history of protests and unrest.  The image shows a group of people riding in small, toy-like vehicles that resemble train cars, with some individuals standing on top of the vehicles. This is not a typical sight in a city street, and it could be interpreted as a form of protest or a creative expression of dissent.  The presence of a crowd of people and the fact that the vehicles are being driven on a public street suggest that this is a public event or gathering. The vehicles themselves are not common sights on city streets, which adds to the unusual nature of the scene.  Overall, the text and the image together suggest that the streets of Ferguson are indeed looking different tonight due to this unusual event.
The text in the image reads: "THANK YOU FOR THE ADVICE #Palestine" which is a message of gratitude. It does not contain anything that goes against common sense.

The statement is not inherently against common sense, as it is a commentary on the perception of injustice and the use of force against certain groups of people. However, it is a political statement and may be interpreted differently by different individuals based on their perspectives and beliefs.  It's important to note that the situation in Ferguson and the experiences of Palestinians are complex and multifaceted, and the comparison made in the text is a simplification of the issues at hand.
The text on the sign in the image reads: "Occupation is a CRIME,from #Ferguson to #Palestine!AntiWar Committee Chicago #StandWithFerguson #MikeBrown @AntiWarMN"  The statement "Occupation is a CRIME" is a subjective opinion and is not necessarily against common sense.

The rest of the text appears to be a call to action or a show of solidarity with specific causes, such as the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, and the situation in Palestine. These are political statements that are open to interpretation and are not necessarily against common sense.  The hashtags and mentions of organizations suggest that the sign is part of a larger movement or campaign, which is a common way for people to express their views and support for various causes.

The hashtags and mentions suggest that the sign is related to social justice issues, including the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, and the situation in Palestine. The AntiWar Committee is likely advocating for peace and justice in these contexts.

The text is encouraging people to participate in a public demonstration to show their support for the cause.  Whether or not the text is against common sense would depend on the individual's perspective on the event and the methods used to express support. Some might view such a demonstration as a legitimate form of expression, while others might argue that it disrupts public order or is not the most effective way to bring about change.

It is a reminder that in situations where there is a clear distinction between right and wrong, remaining neutral is not an option if one wishes to stand on the side of justice and equality. The quote is often used to encourage people to take a stand against injustice and to support those who are oppressed.

The text is suggesting that Palestinians can empathize with the African American community in the United States due to their shared experience of being unarmed and shot.  The statement is not inherently against common sense, as it is attempting to draw a parallel between two groups of people who have experienced similar injustices. However, it is important to note that the situation in Gaza and the West Bank is complex and multifaceted, and making such a comparison may oversimplify the issues at hand. Additionally, the statement does not provide context for the specific circumstances of the shooting in Ferguson, which may have involved different factors than those faced by Palestinians.

It encourages people to "Fix the House" and mentions a "Moocher in Nevada from Law Enforcement" as part of a larger narrative about "Patriots" and "Blacks protesting the killing of an unarmed teenager."

The statement "They didn't give the chief no type of time to rehearse his lines and now he stuck looking like... #Ferguson" is a play on words, suggesting that the police chief was not prepared for the situation and is now in a difficult position, much like the city of Ferguson was during the unrest.  The humor in the text is derived from the juxtaposition of the police chief's apparent lack of preparation with the serious and complex issues that arose in Ferguson. It's important to note that humor is subjective, and what one person finds funny, another might find offensive or in poor taste.  The text does not contain anything that goes against common sense. It's a form of satire, using exaggeration and absurdity to make a point or to entertain. However, it's important to approach such topics with sensitivity, as they involve real people and real events that have had a significant impact on communities.

The text in the image is in Turkish, and it seems to be making a point about the media coverage of the Ferguson protests in comparison to other events.

The article seems to be comparing the media coverage of the Ferguson protests with the events of May 3, which is a sensitive topic in Turkey. The claim that US media ignored the Ferguson protests could be subjective and might not align with the actual media coverage in the United States.  It's important to note that media coverage can vary widely based on the news outlets and their priorities, and it's not uncommon for different media outlets to focus on different stories. The claim that US media ignored the Ferguson protests could be a matter of perspective and the specific news outlets being referenced.

The table is a statistical representation of data, and it is important to interpret such data with care, considering the context of the study and the limitations of the data.

The text you've provided is a meme that uses a photo of a police officer holding a baby to make a statement about the Ferguson protests and the release of the photo of Officer Darren Wilson. The meme is intended to be humorous or satirical, but it's important to note that it's a form of internet humor and not a factual statement.  The meme suggests that the photo of Officer Wilson would look like the one of the police officer holding the baby, which is a play on the idea that the officer might be perceived as less threatening or more approachable when seen in a non-professional context.

The meme is also making a political statement, which is not inherently against common sense.

The statement also mentions that there is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender. It further states that the prolonged release of the officer's name and then the subsequent alleged information regarding a robbery is the reason why the family and the local community have such distrust for the local law enforcement agencies.  The statement concludes by stating that it is no way transparent to release the still photographs of the officer that executed him, as it is the world's brutal execution of an unarmed teenager.

The text suggests that Mike Brown, who was known for wearing baggy pants and scandals, has changed his appearance and attire to look more like a typical person.  The statement "So in 5mins mike brown shaved his head and changed his scandals to shoes" is a play on words, implying that the person in the image has undergone a significant transformation in a very short period of time. The humor is derived from the exaggeration of the changes and the implication that the person has altered their appearance to conform to societal norms.  However, the text is not factual and is likely meant to be humorous or satirical rather than a statement of fact. It does not go against common sense in the sense of presenting information that is contrary to known facts or logical reasoning. It is important to note that the text is not a reliable source of information about the events in Ferguson and should not be taken as a factual account.

The issue with the arrival time on the report is that it does not make sense in the context of the incident. The report states that the incident occurred at 08/09/2014 11:51 PM, but the officer arrived at the scene at 08/09/2014 11:54 PM, which is after the incident time.

Brown was put in an undercover SUV" seems to imply that the police chief was involved in a cover-up or deception regarding the presence of an ambulance.

However, it's important to note that the text is a screenshot of a social media post, and without additional context or evidence, it's not possible to determine the veracity of the claim. It's always advisable to verify information from multiple sources before drawing conclusions.

The text you provided appears to be a statement from the police chief of Ferguson, Missouri, regarding the shooting of Michael Brown. The statement suggests that the officer who shot Brown did not know that he was a robbery suspect.  From a common sense perspective, it is not unusual for law enforcement officers to not know the full details of a situation when they first respond to a call. In many cases, officers are given limited information about a situation and must make decisions based on the information they have at the time. It is also possible that the officer did not know that Brown was a robbery suspect, or that he was involved in any criminal activity.  However, it is important to note that the circumstances surrounding the shooting of Michael Brown are complex and have been the subject of much debate and investigation. The statement from the police chief is just one piece of information in a larger context, and it is important to consider all available information when forming an opinion about the events that occurred.
The text you provided seems to be a commentary on a situation involving a police officer and a person named Mike Brown. The text mentions that the police officer was unaware of any robbery and stopped Mike Brown for jaywalking.

It is possible that the officer did not have information about a robbery in progress and was acting on a different reason for the stop, such as jaywalking.  The statement "stopped #MikeBrown for jay walking" is a bit more ambiguous. Jaywalking is generally considered a minor traffic violation, and it is not clear from the text whether Mike Brown was actually jaywalking or if the officer believed he was.  Without more context or information, it is difficult to determine if there is anything in the text that goes against common sense. However, it is important to note that the text appears to be a commentary on a specific event, and it may not be providing a complete or accurate account of the situation.

It is a factual statement based on the information available at the time the text was written.  However, the context of the statement and the implications it might have can be subject to interpretation and debate. The text does not provide enough information to determine if the statement is accurate or if it is part of a larger narrative that might be misleading or incomplete.

The text you provided appears to be a statement or a headline, but it does not provide any context or evidence to support the claim that an officer identified as the killer of an unarmed teen in Ferguson, Missouri, has left the area.

The image shows a police officer speaking into a microphone, surrounded by a group of people, including other officers and possibly members of the media.  The statement "Officer in shooting death of MIchael Brown was unaware he was a suspect" is a factual statement that could be true or false depending on the context and the specific circumstances surrounding the shooting death of Michael Brown. It is not a statement that goes against common sense.  It is important to note that the image does not provide enough information to determine the truthfulness of the statement. The statement would need to be evaluated in the context of the investigation and any evidence that has been presented.
The text in the image appears to be a meme or a humorous commentary on a situation. It references the Ferguson, Missouri, incident involving the shooting of Michael Brown.

However, it's important to note that the text is not a direct quote from the police chief or any official statement.

This statement is a bit confusing because it seems to be a question, but it's not clear what the question is referring to. If you're asking if there's anything in the text that contradicts common sense, then the answer is no. The text is a simple statement that doesn't contain any information that would go against common sense.  If you're asking about the map itself, there doesn't appear to be anything inherently unusual or against common sense.

There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward statement of an event that has occurred. The text is informative and does not contain any contradictory or nonsensical information.
The image you've provided appears to be a screenshot of a flight tracking website, showing the flight path of an Airbus A320 with the registration number 4U9525. The text overlay on the image suggests that the flight is experiencing a technical issue and is likely to crash.  The text "Airbus A320 #4U9525 crash" is a headline that is not consistent with the information provided by the flight tracking data. The data shows the flight's altitude, speed, and other technical details, but it does not indicate that the flight is crashing. The altitude is at 3800 feet, which is a normal cruising altitude for commercial flights.  The text "Flight tracking data here:" is a statement that is not in conflict with common sense, as it is a factual statement about the content of the image.  The rest of the text "according to the pictures and news text" is a statement that is not in conflict with common sense, as it is a factual statement about the source of the information.  The text "UTCT TIME" is a statement that is not in conflict with common sense, as it is a factual statement about the time zone used in the flight tracking data.  The text "04:59" is a statement that is not in conflict with common sense, as it is
The image you've provided appears to be a screenshot from a flight tracking website, showing the flight path of an aircraft. The text in the image indicates that the aircraft is a DUS (Duty Unit Shuttle) and is flying over a mountainous area.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The text is providing information about the aircraft's flight path, altitude, and other details that are typical for flight tracking websites. The aircraft is shown to be flying at a high altitude, which is consistent with the typical cruising altitude for commercial flights to minimize air resistance and fuel consumption.  The text also mentions that the aircraft is flying over a mountainous area, which is a common route for flights to take advantage of the terrain to reduce fuel consumption. This is a standard practice in air travel and is not unusual or counterintuitive.
The image you've provided appears to be a screenshot from the website FlightRadar24, which is used to track aircraft around the world. The text in the image indicates that the plane's last position was over a mountainous area, which is not a typical place for an aircraft to be.  The text also mentions that the plane is "flying over the mountains," which is a common sense description of the plane's location. However, the context of the text suggests that the plane is not flying over the mountains but rather has been lost or is in a state of distress, as it is described as being "lost" and "in distress."  The text "FlightRadar24 has this as the plane's last position" implies that the plane's last known position was over the mountains, which is not a typical place for an aircraft to be. This is an unusual and potentially alarming situation, as it is not common for aircraft to be flying over mountainous areas, especially if they are in distress.  Therefore, the text in the image does not go against common sense in terms of the plane's last known position, but it does suggest an unusual and potentially dangerous situation.
The image you've provided appears to be a screenshot from the website FlightRadar24, which is used to track aircraft around the world. The text in the image is a bit blurry, but it seems to be showing information about an aircraft, including its registration number, model, and altitude.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a typical display of information that one might expect to see when tracking an aircraft. The text is clear and provides details about the aircraft's flight path, altitude, and other relevant information.
The text provided in the image seems to be a mix of information and a statement that is not entirely accurate. The statement "Germanwings A320 D-AIPX is one of the oldest A320 with serial number 0147 and was delivered in Nov 1990 #4U9525" is not entirely accurate because it is not clear what the "#4U9525" refers to. It is possible that it is a registration number or a code related to the aircraft, but without additional context, it is not possible to determine its significance.  The rest of the text appears to be a factual statement about the age of the aircraft and its delivery date. However, it is important to note that the age of an aircraft does not necessarily determine its safety or reliability. Modern aircraft are designed to have long service lives, and many older aircraft are still in operation today.  In general, the text seems to be a combination of factual information and a statement that is not entirely accurate. It is always important to verify information from multiple sources before accepting it as fact.
The image you've provided appears to be a map with a series of red dots, which are likely to represent the last few positions of a flight path. The text "Last few positions of the @germanwings flight plotted on a map" suggests that this is a visual representation of the flight's path, possibly for the purpose of analysis or investigation.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward statement describing the content of the image. If you are referring to the flight path itself, it is not uncommon for flights to follow predetermined routes, and the image does not provide any information that would contradict this.  If you are asking about the context of the flight path, it is important to note that the image does not provide any information about the circumstances surrounding the flight, such as the cause of the incident or the status of the passengers and crew. Therefore, any conclusions drawn from the image alone would be speculative and not based on common sense.
The image you've provided appears to be a screenshot of a map with a series of red dots, which are likely representing the last few positions of a flight path. The text overlaying the image seems to be a news headline or a social media post, but it's not entirely clear due to the resolution and angle of the image.  From what I can discern, the text mentions "Germanwings," which is a defunct airline that ceased operations in 2015 after a tragic accident involving one of its aircraft. The text also mentions "last few positions," which suggests that the map is showing the final stages of the flight path, possibly in relation to the accident.  There's nothing in the text that goes against common sense.

The text in the image appears to be discussing a crash involving an A320 aircraft. It mentions that the plane was flying over mountains, which is not unusual for commercial flights. However, the text also suggests that the plane was flying at a low altitude, which is not typical for commercial flights, especially over mountainous terrain. This is because flying at low altitudes over mountains can be dangerous due to the risk of terrain clearance and the potential for turbulence.  The text also mentions that the plane was flying at a low altitude over a populated area, which is indeed unusual and would be considered a significant safety concern. It is not common for commercial flights to fly at low altitudes over populated areas due to the risk of accidents and the potential for noise pollution.  Therefore, the text does not go against common sense in terms of the general idea that commercial flights do not fly at low altitudes over mountains.

The text in the image states: "France plane crash - Germanwings jet with 148 people on board crashes in Alps."  There are a few issues with this statement:  1. The location of the crash is specified as the Alps, which is in France, not Germany. 2. The airline mentioned, "Germanwings," is a German airline, but the text incorrectly states that the plane is from France. 3. The number of passengers on board is given as 148, which is an unusual number for a commercial aircraft.

The image shows a Germanwings airplane on the runway, and the text mentions that the plane crashed in France. However, the text also states that the plane was "not in the air." This statement is contradictory to the common sense understanding of a plane crash, as a plane crash typically involves an aircraft that was in the air before it crashed.  The statement "not in the air" could be interpreted in a few ways:  1. The plane was on the ground when the incident occurred. 2. The plane was in the air but had not yet crashed. 3. The plane was in the air but was not involved in a crash.  Without additional context, it's difficult to determine the exact meaning of this statement. However, it is clear that the text contains an inconsistency that may confuse readers.
The text in the image appears to be a screenshot of a flight tracking website, specifically "planefinder.net," which is displaying information about a flight that went down. The text does not contain anything that goes against common sense. It is a factual statement about the flight and the ongoing search and rescue operation.  The text mentions that the flight went down in the area where helicopters are being tracked, which is a standard procedure in search and rescue operations.

However, the text also includes a hashtag that suggests the image is of the actual plane that has crashed. This is not a typical way to describe an airplane crash, as it is not common to refer to an actual crashed aircraft as "the actual #Germanwings plane that has crashed."  The hashtag "#AirbusCrash" is also unusual because it does not specify the type of aircraft that has crashed. It is more common to refer to a specific model or brand of aircraft in such a context.  Additionally, the text mentions "according to @flightradar24," which implies that the information is sourced from a Twitter account. However, without further context, it is not clear how this information is relevant to the image or the situation described.  Overall, the text contains some elements that are not typical for a description of an airplane crash, and it may not be entirely accurate or clear.
The text in the image states:  "Un avion A320 d√ªne compagnie all√©mande s'est √©cras√© dans les Alpes, pr√®s de Digne-les-Bains en fin de matin√©e. Les conditions m√©t√©o √©taient calmes au moment du crash."  The statement "Les conditions m√©t√©o √©taient calmes au moment du crash" seems to contradict common sense, as one would expect that a crash involving an A320, a large commercial aircraft, would typically occur in adverse weather conditions, such as turbulence, strong winds, or poor visibility. The fact that the weather was described as calm at the time of the crash is unusual and might suggest that there were other factors at play, such as mechanical failure or human error.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a social media post, and it reads:  "#Germanwings crash in Alps"  This statement is not inherently against common sense, as it is a factual report of an event that occurred.

In the aftermath of a plane crash, it is not uncommon for rescue teams to search for survivors, and it is not uncommon for people to be found alive in such situations. The fact that the French president would make such a statement is highly unusual and does not align with the standard response to a plane crash.  It is important to note that the tweet is not from the official account of the French president, and it is likely that the account is not affiliated with the French government. The statement is likely to be a hoax or a misleading piece of information.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline, which seems to be reporting on a plane crash involving a French President's plane. However, the text also includes a statement that says, "French President Francois Hollande says there are likely no survivors."

The image you've provided appears to be a map with a flight path overlaid, showing the route taken by a Germanwings A320 aircraft. The text in the image is not clear enough to read, so I'm unable to provide specific details about the content of the text.  However, I can comment on the flight path itself. The flight path shown in the image is a straight line, which is not typical for commercial flights. Commercial flights usually follow predetermined routes known as airways or air routes, which are established by international aviation organizations like the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). These routes are designed to minimize fuel consumption, reduce noise pollution over populated areas, and ensure the safety of aircraft by avoiding areas with high levels of air traffic.  The straight line flight path shown in the image could be a result of various factors, such as a direct route between the departure and arrival airports, a deviation due to air traffic control instructions, or an emergency situation where the aircraft is following the most direct route to its destination.  Without more context or information, it's difficult to determine the exact reason for the flight path shown in the image. It's also important to note that the image does not provide any information about the circumstances surrounding the flight, such as the cause of the incident, the actions of the crew, or the status of the passengers and crew on board.

This suggests that the image is related to a news story or exclusive content from a French news outlet. The text does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward statement indicating that the image is exclusive to the La Provence website.
The text in the image appears to be a statement made by a person on Twitter, which is not a reliable source of information. The statement "If one pilot leaves, somebody else is supposed to go in so there are always 2 people" is not consistent with standard operating procedures for commercial airline flights.  In general, commercial airplanes are operated by a crew of two pilots, one of whom is the captain and the other is the first officer. The captain is responsible for flying the aircraft, while the first officer assists in navigation, communication, and other tasks. The crew is trained to handle various situations, including emergencies, and to work together as a team.  The statement in the image suggests that there is a misconception about the role of pilots in an airplane. It is not common practice for a pilot to leave the cockpit and for another pilot to immediately take over, especially in the context of an emergency. The statement is likely to be inaccurate or misleading, and it is important to rely on credible sources of information for accurate and up-to-date news.
The image you've provided appears to be a diagram illustrating the process of unlocking and locking the cockpit door on an airplane. The text accompanying the diagram suggests three different scenarios for unlocking the door:  1. By default when closed. 2. By a control toggle. 3. By a norm lock.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The diagram and text seem to be providing a clear and logical explanation of how the cockpit door can be unlocked and locked in different situations. The scenarios are consistent with the typical procedures followed by pilots and crew members in an aircraft.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a social media post about the Germanwings crash. It reads:  "Germanwings crash: 150 people dead, 100 passengers and crew on board."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It provides a clear and factual statement about the number of people who were on board the aircraft and the number of fatalities.

It is a straightforward announcement or reminder about a news segment that will discuss the tragic event of Germanwings Flight 9525. The hashtags are used to identify the topic and the source of the news.
The text you've provided seems to be a humorous or sarcastic statement, suggesting that having no pilots in the cockpit might be better than having one. This statement goes against common sense because it implies that a lack of pilots would be safer or more efficient than having a trained and certified pilot at the controls of an aircraft.  In reality, pilots are essential for the safe operation of an aircraft. They are trained to handle various situations, make critical decisions, and ensure the safety of passengers and crew. The absence of a pilot would be extremely dangerous and would likely result in a catastrophic failure of the aircraft's systems.  The statement is likely meant to be a joke or a commentary on the perceived inefficiency or incompetence of pilots, but it is important to remember that pilots play a crucial role in aviation safety.
The image you've provided appears to be taken from the cockpit of an airplane, showing the instrument panel and the pilot's seat. The text in the image seems to be a news headline or a caption that reads, "Here's why the Germanwings crash scenario is less likely in the U.S."  The text is likely referring to the crash of Germanwings Flight 951 in 2014, which was a tragic event where both pilots were found to be dead before the aircraft crashed into the French Alps. The statement in the text is a generalization and may not be entirely accurate or based on factual information.  The text does not go against common sense, as it is a statement about the likelihood of a specific scenario, which is the crash of an airplane due to the actions of the pilots. However, it is important to note that the likelihood of any airplane crash is extremely low, and the aviation industry in the United States has a strong safety record.  The statement in the text is likely meant to provide context or commentary on the crash of Germanwings Flight 951, but without additional information, it is difficult to determine the accuracy or basis of the statement.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline that reads: "BREAKING NEWS: CO-PILOT REPROGRAMMED AUTOPILOT TO CRASH PLANE."  The statement "CO-PILOT REPROGRAMMED AUTOPILOT TO CRASH PLANE" is a sensational and extraordinary claim that goes against common sense and the known facts about airplane accidents. It is highly improbable that a co-pilot would intentionally crash an airplane, especially by reprogramming the autopilot.  The statement is likely a misinterpretation or a speculative theory that has not been substantiated by any credible sources. It is important to note that the news headline is not a reliable source of information and should not be taken as fact.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline and a quote from an aviation attorney, Justin Green. The headline reads: "REPORT: CO-PILOT REPROGRAMMED AUTOPILOT TO CRASH PLANE."  The quote from Justin Green states: "To cap its liability, the airline has to prove it was without fault - Aviation Attorney Justin Green on #Germanwings."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The headline suggests that the co-pilot intentionally programmed the autopilot to crash the plane, which is a serious allegation that would be investigated thoroughly. The quote from Justin Green is a statement about the legal implications for the airline in such a scenario, which is a standard part of any legal discussion regarding aviation accidents.  It's important to note that the headline and the quote are part of a news report, and the information presented is based on the available evidence at the time the report was made. The actual circumstances of the incident are subject to ongoing investigation and legal proceedings.

The text in the image describes the security measures implemented in the cockpit of an airplane to prevent unauthorized access. It mentions that the cockpit door separates the cockpit from the passenger cabin, and that the door automatically locks when closed. Additionally, the text states that the cockpit doors were strengthened after the events of September 11, 2001, to prevent takeovers.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The measures described are standard security protocols for aircraft cockpits to ensure the safety of passengers and crew. These measures include physical barriers, such as the cockpit door, and electronic security systems that lock the door when closed. The text also correctly notes that these measures were implemented after the tragic events of September 11, 2001, to enhance security.
The text in the image appears to be a tribute to the lives lost in the Germanwings crash, set to music by Oleg Bryjak and Maria Radner. The text reads "RIP 4U525," which seems to be a reference to the flight number of the Germanwings flight that crashed.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward message of condolence and remembrance for the victims of the crash. The use of the flight number as part of the tribute is a common way to pay respects to those who lost their lives in an aviation tragedy.
The text in the image appears to be a religious prayer or message, expressing a desire for peace and comfort in the context of a difficult situation. It does not contain anything that goes against common sense. The message is a call for prayer and support for those affected by a tragic event.
The text in the image states, "This video shows how the cockpit door of the crashed #Germanwings plane was designed to work." However, the image itself shows a hand manipulating the door lock, which is not how a cockpit door is typically operated.  In reality, cockpit doors are designed to be securely locked from the inside, and they are not meant to be opened from the outside by hand. They are usually opened from the inside by the pilot or co-pilot using a key or a combination of buttons and levers. The door is then secured in the locked position.  The image appears to be staged or manipulated to show the door lock being operated by hand, which is not how it would function in a real-world scenario. This could be done for demonstration purposes or as part of an investigation into the crash of the Germanwings plane, but it does not accurately represent how a cockpit door is designed to work.
The text you provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It appears to be a statement about a specific flight and its possible origin, which is consistent with the information that would be provided in the context of a breaking news story.

The text in the image appears to be a screenshot from a flight tracking website, FlightRadar24, showing the flight path of a Germanwings flight. The text at the top of the image seems to be a news headline or a summary of an event, which is not directly related to the flight tracking information.  The headline mentions "Germanwings flight #4U9525 (registration D-AIPX)" and states that the flight was lost from FlightRadar24 at 6800 feet at 09.39 UTC time. This statement is not consistent with the information provided by FlightRadar24, which shows the flight path and altitude of the aircraft.  The FlightRadar24 screenshot shows the flight path of the aircraft, with the last known position at 6800 feet, which is not consistent with the headline's statement that the flight was lost from FlightRadar24. FlightRadar24 is a service that tracks flights and provides real-time information about their location, altitude, and other details. It is not possible for a flight to be "lost" from FlightRadar24, as the service relies on data from various sources, including aircraft transponders, to track flights.  Therefore, the headline in the image is not consistent with the information provided by FlightRadar2
The text "breaking Airbus A320 crashes in southern France with 148 people on board" appears to be a news headline. However, the image provided does not show an Airbus A320 or any indication of a crash in southern France. The image shows a stylized representation of a globe with a red hue, which does not correspond to the content of the news headline.  The text "Germanwings" is also not a standard way to refer to an Airbus A320, as Germanwings was a regional airline that ceased operations in 2014 and was not associated with the Airbus A320. The Airbus A320 is a medium-haul, wide-body, four-engine jet airliner manufactured by Airbus.  Therefore, the text and the image do not match each other, and the information provided does not correspond to any known or verifiable event. It seems to be a fictional or misleading combination of elements.

The text you provided seems to be a description of a flight's altitude changes, which is a normal part of a flight's trajectory. It is not uncommon for flights to climb to a cruising altitude and then descend as they approach their destination. The statement "before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet" is a bit unusual because it implies that the flight lost communication at a relatively low altitude, which is not typical for commercial flights. However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine if this is an accurate description of the flight's path or if there's an error in the text.
The text in the image appears to be a description of a flight's altitude changes, which is consistent with common sense. It mentions that the flight climbed to a high altitude, then started to descend and lost signal at a lower altitude. This is a typical sequence of events for an aircraft during its flight, as it ascends to reach its cruising altitude, then descends to prepare for landing.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense, as it accurately describes the flight's altitude changes.
The text "150 people were on board: 142 passengers and 8 crew members" seems to be a contradiction. It is unusual to have 150 people on board a commercial airplane, as most commercial aircraft have a maximum seating capacity of around 500 passengers, with a few exceptions for larger aircraft.  The number of passengers and crew members on board a commercial airplane is typically determined by the aircraft's weight and balance limits, as well as safety regulations. Overloading an aircraft can lead to safety issues, including reduced maneuverability, longer takeoff and landing distances, and potential structural damage.  Therefore, the text appears to be incorrect or misleading, as it suggests a situation that would be highly unusual and potentially dangerous.

The text you provided seems to be a commentary on the situation in Sydney, Australia, where there was a hostage situation in December 2014. The statement "Really hope #sydneysiege hostage are rescued. But worth noting most jihadi victims are Muslims" is a controversial statement that goes against common sense.  Firstly, it is not appropriate to make generalizations about the victims of terrorism, as they are individuals who have suffered a tragic event. It is important to remember that victims of terrorism come from all walks of life and all religions. To suggest that most victims of jihadi terrorism are Muslim is a misleading and insensitive statement that can contribute to stereotypes and misunderstandings.  Secondly, the statement is factually incorrect. While it is true that the majority of victims of terrorism in recent years have been Muslims, it is not accurate to say that "most" victims are Muslim. Terrorism affects people of all religions, ethnicities, and nationalities.  In summary, the statement in the text is not in line with common sense and is both factually incorrect and insensitive to the victims of terrorism.
The text in the image is in Arabic and it reads "Allah is the Greatest" which is a common phrase in Islam. However, the context in which this phrase is used can be important. In the context of a flag, it could be associated with a group that uses this phrase as part of their ideology or identity. Without additional context, it's not possible to determine the specific group or the intentions behind the use of this phrase on a flag.  Regarding the statement "Remember, Sydney terrorists have nothing to do with Islam," this is a common sentiment expressed by many Muslims and non-Muslims alike, as terrorism is not a part of Islam and is condemned by the majority of the Muslim community. The statement is a reminder that terrorism is a criminal act and should not be associated with any religion.  The translation of the Arabic text in the image is accurate and does not go against common sense. It is a phrase that is widely recognized and understood within the Islamic community.

The tweet is using a derogatory term to criticize the Greens MP, which is a form of political attack.

Therefore, it is not appropriate to make broad statements about the victims of violence based solely on this image.

The text in the image appears to be a headline from a newspaper, which reads: "DEATH CULT CBD ATTACK."

The headline is sensational and may be considered misleading or inaccurate by some. It implies a direct link between the attack and a death cult, which may not be the case.

The statement is clear and informative, and it is consistent with what one would expect from a police communication during an emergency situation.
The text in the image appears to be a political statement or commentary, rather than a factual statement. It seems to be expressing a viewpoint that the focus on political correctness in Australia is misplaced, given the perceived threat of jihad. The text suggests that the authorities should be more concerned with terrorism, which is a serious issue that requires attention.  The statement "We have not yet confirmed this is a terrorism related event" is a commentary on the response to a specific event, which is not identified in the image. It implies that the speaker believes that the authorities should be more proactive in addressing the potential for terrorism.  The text also includes a hashtag (#tcot), which is often used to express a conservative or right-wing political viewpoint. The use of the hashtag suggests that the speaker is likely expressing a conservative or right-wing perspective on the issue.  The statement "INSANITY! #Jihad comes 2 Australia &amp; Liberal Lunatics are Concerned with Political Correctness!? #sydneysiege" is a hyperbolic expression of shock or disbelief, suggesting that the speaker finds it absurd that political correctness is a concern in the face of a potential jihadist threat.  Overall, the text is a political commentary that expresses a viewpoint on the balance between addressing

However, the statement about gun rights and self-defense is a topic of ongoing debate and discussion, with differing opinions on the balance between the right to bear arms and public safety.
The text in the image appears to be a message from a social media platform, possibly in response to a crisis or event. It reads:  "My thoughts go out to everyone who has been affected in any way by the horrific events that unfolded today in Martin Place. This includes, but is certainly not limited to, the wider Islamic community, who will inevitably be subjected to a barrage of hateful, misguided, ignorant abuse because of the actions of a small minority of extremists who happen to share their faith. Please remember not to tar every person with the same brush when sitting through social media, and to also appreciate the validity of such information with vigilance."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It expresses empathy and understanding towards the wider Islamic community, acknowledging that they may face backlash due to the actions of a small group of extremists.

This statement might be interpreted as suggesting that news outlets are not reliable sources of information. While it's true that not all news outlets are equally reliable, and that it's important to verify information from multiple sources, it's also important to recognize that reputable news outlets often have a team of professional journalists who fact-check and verify their stories before publication.  In general, the text is providing sound advice for how to navigate social media during a crisis, and it's important to approach such situations with caution and a critical eye.
The text in the image appears to be a comment on a social media post, and it seems to be expressing a strong negative opinion about the situation depicted in the photo.

The comment is critical of the individuals' actions, implying that they are not acting in a way that is appropriate for the circumstances. It suggests that the individuals are prioritizing their own self-expression or social media presence over the safety and well-being of themselves and others around them.  The comment is also critical of the situation itself, implying that it is a serious and concerning event. The use of the hashtag #sydneysiege suggests that the commenter is referring to a specific event that has taken place in Sydney, Australia.  Overall, the comment is expressing a strong negative opinion about the actions of the individuals in the photo and the situation they are in. It is not providing any factual information but is rather an emotional response to the situation.

The hashtag #sydneysiege is associated with a series of events that occurred in Sydney, Australia, in December 2014, where a gunman held hostages in a caf√© for 16 hours. The events were a significant crisis in Sydney and resulted in the deaths of two people.  The statement that the Sydney Opera House has canceled performances due to the #sydneysiege events is consistent with common sense, as such a cancellation would be a reasonable response to a major security incident in the city. The Opera House is a prominent landmark and a popular tourist destination, and it would be prudent to cancel performances as a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of visitors and staff.  Therefore, the text does not go against common sense. It accurately reflects the situation as it would be expected that the Opera House would take such measures in response to a major security incident in the city.

However, it's important to note that the impact of such events on the families of the hostages can be profound and long-lasting, and the media coverage can have a significant effect on public perception and the healing process for those affected.  The statement you've made about the newspaper further terrorizing family members of the hostages is a subjective interpretation of the media's role in reporting on such events. It's a complex issue with many facets, and the impact of media coverage on individuals and communities is a topic of ongoing debate.
The text in the image appears to be a quote from Anders Breivik, who is known for his involvement in a mass shooting in Norway in 2011.

It is important to note that Breivik's views are extreme and do not reflect the actions or beliefs of the majority of non-Muslims.

The statement suggests that there may be some indications that the siege is politically motivated, which is a reasonable assumption given the context of the situation. The text does not contain any information that is contradictory or illogical.
The text in the image reads: "Their faces say it all. #Sydneysiege continues more&gt;"  The statement "Their faces say it all" is a subjective interpretation and does not necessarily go against common sense. It suggests that the expressions on the individuals' faces convey a message or emotion that is significant or relevant to the situation at hand.

The image shows a pie chart with two labels: "Muslims" and "Al-Qaeda." The chart indicates that Muslims make up 1.57 billion of the world's population, while Al-Qaeda has 10,000 members.  The text "Sadly, this needs to be pointed out with the amount of Islamophobia that is currently being posted" suggests that the chart is being used to counteract Islamophobia by showing the vast difference in numbers between Muslims and Al-Qaeda.  There is nothing inherently wrong or against common sense in the text itself. It is a statement about the need to combat Islamophobia with accurate information. However, the context in which this image is being used is important. If the image is being used to suggest that all Muslims are associated with Al-Qaeda, that would be against common sense and a misrepresentation of the facts. It is crucial to differentiate between the actions of a small extremist group and the beliefs and practices of the vast majority of Muslims.
The text in the image states "Muslims 1.57 billion Al-Qaeda 10,000 Taliban 36,000." This information is not accurate and goes against common sense. It suggests that a very small fraction of Muslims (0.0007%) are associated with Al-Qaeda, and an even smaller fraction (0.00002%) are associated with the Taliban. This is not representative of the global Muslim population, which is diverse and not monolithically associated with these extremist groups. The text is likely intended to counter the stereotype that all Muslims are associated with terrorism, but it does so in a way that is misleading and not reflective of the reality of the Muslim community.

The third tweet from Hannah Groff is a call for people to follow her account, @PalindromicGirl, and mentions a specific bus route and a religious attire, suggesting that she is offering a ride to someone in religious attire.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The tweets are meant to be light-hearted and humorous, playing on the situation in Sydney with a sense of community and support. The messages are not promoting any actions that would be considered harmful or against common sense.
The image you've provided appears to be a screenshot of a news article from the BBC, discussing updates on the Sydney caf√© siege.

A lot of people have come to watch the hostage situation. Some people are bringing beers and taking selfies."  The statement that "some people are bringing beers and taking selfies" might be seen as going against common sense, as it seems insensitive to the seriousness of a hostage situation. Typically, people would not be expected to be casually enjoying beverages and taking selfies in the vicinity of a hostage crisis, as it could be perceived as disrespectful or even inappropriate. However, it's important to note that this is a quote from a reporter, and it's possible that the reporter is describing the behavior of some individuals in the area, not necessarily endorsing it.

LIVE:"  The text is not inherently against common sense. It seems to be a straightforward statement about a current event.

The text "Shameful tourists take selfies at scene of #SydneySiege" implies that it is inappropriate for tourists to take selfies at a location where a tragic event, such as the Sydney Siege, has occurred. The implication is that the tourists are being insensitive or disrespectful by taking selfies in such a setting.  However, the text does not provide any specific information about the location or the context of the event. It is possible that the location is not directly related to the Sydney Siege, or that the event is not as significant as the text suggests. Without more context, it is difficult to determine if the text accurately reflects the situation or if it is an exaggeration or misinterpretation.

It does not go against common sense, as it is a standard practice for law enforcement agencies to not disclose the exact number of hostages involved in a siege situation. This is done to protect the identities of the individuals involved and to maintain the integrity of any ongoing investigations.  The statement is consistent with what one would expect from a law enforcement agency in such a situation.

The text you provided is a commentary on the situation in Sydney, Australia, where there was a hostage situation. The text is making a statement about the inappropriateness of taking selfies during a crisis or emergency.  The text is not against common sense. It is a statement of opinion about the behavior of some individuals during a serious event. The text is suggesting that taking selfies in such a situation is disrespectful and in poor taste, as it can be seen as trivializing the gravity of the situation.  The text is not making a statement about the event itself, but rather about the behavior of some individuals in response to the event. It is a commentary on the human response to a crisis, rather than a statement of fact about the event itself.
The text in the image appears to be a statement that associates the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) with other groups, including Saudi Arabia, the Taliban, and Al-Nusra. The statement also references the Sydney Siege, which was a hostage situation in Sydney, Australia, in 2014.  The statement is not inherently against common sense, as it is a factual observation that these groups have been associated with each other in various contexts. However, the statement is likely to be controversial due to the political and religious implications of associating ISIS with other groups, and the reference to the Sydney Siege, which was a specific event with its own set of circumstances.  It's important to note that the statement is a simplification and does not capture the complexities and nuances of the relationships between these groups. For example, while there have been links between ISIS and other groups, there are also significant differences and distinctions between them. Similarly, the Sydney Siege was a specific event with its own set of circumstances and motivations, and it is not accurate to equate it with the broader issue of terrorism or extremism.

The image shows a window with Arabic script on it, which is not a flag. The script is likely to be a religious or cultural text, but it is not a flag. Therefore, the caption is incorrect and goes against common sense, as it misidentifies the content of the image as a flag.

The text in the image reads: "YOU CAN'T END HATE WITH HATE #ILLRIDEWITHYOU #PRAYFORSYDNEY."  The statement "YOU CAN'T END HATE WITH HATE" is a common sense principle.

It is a statement that promotes the idea of nonviolence and love as a means of overcoming hate and darkness.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense.

The text appears to be a misinterpretation or a misleading statement, as it does not match the visual content of the images.
The text you provided seems to be a humorous and fictional scenario, as it describes a Rabbi, Imam, and Priest walking into a mosque and shaking hands, which is not a typical event.

Without more information, it is difficult to determine if the statement is accurate or if it is an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the situation.

The text "Uber intros surge pricing in downtown Sydney during hostage siege" seems to be a contradiction in terms. Surge pricing is typically used by ride-sharing companies like Uber to increase prices during peak demand times, such as rush hour or special events. However, during a hostage siege, it would be highly inappropriate and insensitive for a company to introduce surge pricing, as it could be seen as profiting from a tragic and dangerous situation.  The text appears to be a misstatement or a typographical error, as it is unlikely that Uber would engage in such behavior. It is important to note that during a hostage siege or any other emergency, the primary concern should be the safety of the individuals involved and the community as a whole, rather than the profitability of a business.

The headline is informative and accurately describes the content of the image, which shows police officers in protective gear, likely responding to a hostage situation in Sydney.

The text in the image appears to be a news headline that reads: "JUST IN: Flag in #Sydney cafe window confirmed to be that of Jabah Al-Nusra, says Islamic terror expert on 7 News."  The statement "JUST IN" suggests that the information is breaking news or a recent development. The flag in question is associated with Jabah Al-Nusra, a militant group that has been involved in the Syrian civil war and is considered a terrorist organization by many countries, including the United States and Australia.  The presence of such a flag in a cafe window could be seen as concerning, as it might indicate support for or association with a group that is known for violence and terrorism. However, without additional context, it's not possible to determine the exact nature of the situation or the intentions of the individuals involved.  The text does not contain anything that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward news headline that provides information about a recent development.
The text in the image states: "Demand is off the charts! Fares have increased to get more Ubers on the road."  This statement is not necessarily against common sense, as it is a factual observation about the surge pricing strategy employed by Uber. During times of high demand, Uber increases the price of rides to incentivize more drivers to come online and provide rides, thus helping to balance supply and demand. This is a common practice in the ride-sharing industry to ensure that there are enough drivers available to meet the demand for rides.  However, the statement "Ugh: Uber introduces $100 minimum surge pricing during #SydneySiege" could be interpreted as a commentary on the perceived unfairness or high cost of the surge pricing. This is a subjective opinion and not a factual statement.

The flag is identified as that of Jabah Al-Nusra, which is a militant group associated with terrorism.  The headline suggests that the flag is being held up by a person inside the cafe, which is a surprising and unusual sight. The presence of such a flag in a public place like a cafe could be considered a security concern, as it might indicate support for or association with a terrorist organization.  The text does not contain anything that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward news headline reporting an event that is likely to be of public interest due to the sensitive nature of the flag being displayed.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline that reads: "BREAKING NEWS: SYDNEY SIEGE POLICE OPERATION UNDERWAY IN MARTIN PLACE."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense.

The text is clear and informative, providing viewers with the necessary information to understand the situation.
The text in the image mentions that Uber is introducing surge pricing during the Sydney siege. This is not a common sense practice, as surge pricing is typically used by ride-sharing companies to increase prices during peak demand times, such as rush hour or during events that draw large crowds. However, during a crisis or emergency situation like a siege, it is generally considered inappropriate to increase prices, as people may be in a vulnerable or panicked state and may need transportation to safety. This is why the text is highlighting the situation as unusual and potentially controversial.
The text in the image appears to be a screenshot of a fare estimate from a ride-sharing service, which shows a fare of $145.50 for a trip from Sydney Airport to Pitt Street. The text also includes a disclaimer stating that fares may vary due to traffic, weather, and other factors, and that the estimated fare does not include discounts or promotions.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward representation of a fare estimate for a specific trip, with a clear explanation of the factors that could affect the final fare. The text is informative and does not contain any contradictory or nonsensical statements.
The text in the image appears to be a tweet or a headline from a news source. It mentions a situation in Sydney, Australia, where there are reports of hostage-takers who are allegedly wearing suicide belts and demanding a radio conversation with the Prime Minister of Australia.  The statement "according to the pictures and news text" is not clear in this context, as the image does not show any pictures or text that would provide additional context or information about the situation.  The statement about the hostage-takers having suicide belts is a serious allegation and would be considered a threat to public safety. If this were a real-time situation, it would be a matter of concern for the authorities and the public.  However, without more information or context, it is not possible to determine the veracity of the statement or the nature of the situation it refers to. It is important to rely on credible news sources for accurate information and to avoid spreading unverified or potentially misleading information.
The image you've provided appears to be a screenshot of a map with various locations marked, possibly indicating a specific area of interest or concern. The text overlay on the image seems to be a news headline or a caption that reads, "This is the exclusion zone currently in place in Sydney's CBD."  The exclusion zone is typically an area where certain activities or access are restricted due to safety concerns, such as a security threat, a natural disaster, or a public health issue. The text suggests that there is an exclusion zone in Sydney's Central Business District (CBD), which is a common-sense approach to managing risks and ensuring public safety.  Without additional context, it's not possible to determine if the text is accurate or if there's anything in the text that goes against common sense. However, the concept of an exclusion zone is generally understood and is a common practice in many cities around the world to maintain safety and order.
The text in the image appears to be a tweet from Uber Sydney, which seems to be offering free rides in downtown Sydney during a hostage crisis. The statement "Uber Sydney trips from CBD will be free for riders. Higher rates are still in place to encourage drivers to get into the CBD."  The first part of the statement, "Uber Sydney trips from CBD will be free for riders," is unusual because it is not common for companies to offer free services during a crisis, especially in a city where public transportation might be disrupted. This could be seen as a public relations move to show support for the city and its residents during a difficult time.  The second part of the statement, "Higher rates are still in place to encourage drivers to get into the CBD," is also noteworthy. It suggests that despite the free rides for passengers, Uber is still charging higher rates for drivers, which might be seen as counterintuitive. This could be an attempt to balance the supply and demand of drivers in the area, as the demand for rides might be higher during a crisis, but the number of drivers might be lower due to safety concerns.  Overall, the text in the image is unusual and may seem counterintuitive, but it is likely a response to a specific situation and is intended to address the needs of both passengers and drivers during a crisis.

The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a social media post that reads: "Deserted grounds of the evacuated #Sydney Opera House - More on our LIVE page:"  The statement "Deserted grounds of the evacuated #Sydney Opera House" is not inherently against common sense. It describes a situation where the Sydney Opera House, a well-known landmark, is currently not in use, possibly due to an evacuation. The hashtag suggests that there is more information available on a live page, which is a common way to provide updates on a developing situation.  However, without additional context, it's not possible to determine if the evacuation is due to a real emergency or if it's a planned event. If the evacuation is due to a real emergency, then the statement is accurate. If it's a planned event, then the statement might be misleading, as the Opera House is not typically evacuated during regular operations.  The image shows two individuals who appear to be security personnel, possibly police officers, walking along a pathway near the Opera House. Their presence could be related to the evacuation, but without more information, it's not possible to confirm this.

It is important to note that the accuracy of the tweet and the events it describes cannot be confirmed without additional information or a reliable source.

This kind of text is likely intended for entertainment, educational, or illustrative purposes, rather than representing an actual event.
The text in the image appears to be a warning or advisory related to an exclusion zone in Sydney. It mentions that the exclusion zone will be in place tomorrow and that people who work in the area should stay at home. This is a reasonable and common sense measure, as it suggests that there may be a security concern or an ongoing incident that requires people to avoid the area.  The image itself shows a map with various locations marked, including a "Lindt Chocolate Cafe" and "Martin Place." The map also includes a red circle with a line through it, which is a common symbol for a restricted or prohibited area.

It also mentions that the hostages are being threatened with startling consequences if their demands are not met.  The demands listed in the text are indeed unusual and go against common sense. The idea of releasing an Islamic State flag, which is a symbol of a terrorist organization, is not a reasonable or peaceful request. Additionally, the threat of startling consequences if the demands are not met is a form of extortion and is not a legitimate or ethical way to resolve a situation.  It is important to note that the text is a representation of the demands made by the gunmen during the siege, and it is not a call to action or an endorsement of the actions taken by the gunmen. The post is likely intended to raise awareness about the situation and the demands being made, rather than to encourage or support the actions of the gunmen.

The text also discusses the use of the black flag with the white Arabic text of "Shahada" (the Islamic creed) in the context of the Islamic faith. It mentions that the flag was used as a symbol of engagement in jihad, which is a term that can refer to both defensive and offensive warfare in Islamic contexts.  The text does not provide any information that goes against common sense. It is discussing historical and religious aspects of the black flag, which are relevant to the context of the Islamic faith and its history.  However, it is important to note that the black flag with Arabic script is often associated with extremist groups like ISIS, which have used it as a symbol of their ideology and as a flag during their military campaigns. The use of such a flag in the context of the Islamic faith can be controversial due to the association with extremist groups and the violence they have perpetrated.

The text in the image states: "TV channels have chosen not to show videos of hostages relaying #sydneysiege gunman's demands."  This statement is not necessarily against common sense. It is a decision made by media outlets to not broadcast footage of hostages, which is a standard practice in many countries. The reason for this is to protect the safety and well-being of the hostages, as broadcasting their images or the demands of the gunman could potentially put them at greater risk.  However, it is worth noting that the decision to not broadcast such footage is a complex one, and there are differing opinions on the matter. Some argue that not showing the footage can prevent the gunman from gaining further attention, while others believe that it is a violation of the public's right to know.
