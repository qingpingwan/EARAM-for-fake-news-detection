The text in the image appears to be a headline or a summary of a report or article. It states that "Small business optimism maintains postelection surge." This statement is consistent with common sense, as it suggests that small businesses are experiencing a period of increased optimism following an election. This is a typical scenario where businesses may feel more confident about the future after a change in leadership or policy, as they may anticipate positive changes that could benefit their operations.  The graph in the image shows a line that represents the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index, which is a measure of small business owners' perceptions of current business conditions and their expectations for the future. The line indicates that the index has been increasing over time, which aligns with the statement that small business optimism is maintaining a postelection surge.  Therefore, there is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The statement and the accompanying graph both provide information that is consistent with what one might expect based on general knowledge about the behavior of small businesses in response to changes in the political environment.
The text "Unemployment has recently achieved the lowest rate in years" is a statement of fact, and it does not go against common sense. It is a report of an economic statistic, which is typically considered a positive indicator for the economy. The image shows a baby dressed in winter clothing, which is not related to the text and does not go against common sense either.
The text provided in the image appears to be a statement about a situation in Kashmir, which is a region in India. The text suggests that the Indian army is killing and torturing thousands of people in Kashmir, and that they have physically assaulted a woman.  The statement is quite strong and emotive, which is typical for news headlines or social media posts that aim to evoke a strong emotional response from the reader. However, it is important to note that the accuracy of such statements can be difficult to verify without independent confirmation from credible sources.  The images accompanying the text show large crowds of people, some of whom appear to be in distress or grief. The presence of a woman in a crowd of people, who might be in distress, is consistent with the text's description of the situation.  Without additional context or evidence, it is not possible to determine the accuracy of the text's claims. It is always advisable to cross-check information from multiple sources before accepting it as fact.
The text in the image appears to be discussing the testing rates for COVID-19 in various countries and how these rates might affect the reported mortality rates. It suggests that the testing rates in some countries are much higher than in others, which could lead to a higher reported mortality rate in those countries.  From a common sense perspective, it is generally understood that the more testing is done, the more cases of COVID-19 will be detected, which could lead to a higher reported mortality rate. This is because more cases are being identified and reported, not because the mortality rate itself has changed.  However, the text does not provide any information on the actual mortality rates or the number of cases detected in each country. It only discusses the testing rates. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from the text alone whether the reported mortality rates are accurate or not.  It is important to note that the accuracy of reported mortality rates can be influenced by many factors, including the availability of testing, the quality of data collection, and the effectiveness of public health measures. Therefore, while the text raises an interesting point about the potential impact of testing rates on reported mortality rates, it does not provide enough information to draw any definitive conclusions.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline, and it does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward announcement about the approval of clinical trials for a potential coronavirus vaccine by the Brazilian health regulator, Anvisa. The headline is clear and informative, providing a factual update on the development of a vaccine.
The image you've provided appears to be a chart of citrus fruits, categorized by their type and set of six. The text "FRUIT" is prominently displayed at the top, and there are labels for each type of citrus fruit.  The news text at the bottom seems to be a personal statement or a piece of advice rather than a factual statement. It says, "MOH says u Eat a lot of Citrus and Alkaline water hot lemon water too." This statement is not factual and does not go against common sense. It seems to be a personal observation or recommendation, possibly suggesting that the person who wrote it (MOH) has noticed that the individual they are addressing eats a lot of citrus fruits and drinks alkaline water and hot lemon water.  The statement is not contradictory to common sense, as it is a personal observation and not a statement of fact. It is important to note that the statement is not based on any scientific evidence or research and should not be taken as medical advice or a dietary recommendation.
The text you provided discusses the concept of using nuclear bombs for noncombat purposes, such as melting the polar ice caps or nuking the moon. While the idea of using nuclear weapons for such purposes is not a common practice, it is not entirely unheard of. In the past, there have been discussions and proposals for using nuclear technology for various scientific and engineering projects. However, the practicality and ethics of such proposals are highly debated and generally not supported by the scientific community or international law.  The image you've provided appears to be an artistic representation of a nuclear explosion, which is not a real event but rather a piece of artwork or a conceptual illustration. The image does not depict a real scenario but rather serves as a visual metaphor or a thought-provoking piece of art.  The text itself is not inherently against common sense, as it is discussing a topic that has been the subject of scientific and political debates. However, the concept of using nuclear weapons for noncombat purposes is generally considered to be a dangerous and unethical idea, as it would have catastrophic environmental and human consequences.
The text you provided is a humorous statement that is not based on fact. It is a joke that plays on the idea that many Americans might be considering moving to Canada due to political or social reasons, but it is not a reflection of actual events or data. The statement is not supported by any credible sources and is not a reliable indicator of immigration trends or patterns.
The text in the image contains a statement that "Mark Manuel is claimed as Abu Salem." This statement is likely to be false and goes against common sense, as Mark Manuel is a well-known actor and director in the Indian film industry, while Abu Salem is a convicted criminal and a former gangster. It is highly unlikely that Mark Manuel would be associated with Abu Salem, as they are two different individuals with distinct backgrounds and public personas. The claim made in the text is likely to be a misidentification or a piece of misinformation.
The text "BREAKING Fmr. President Trump Salutes from Balcony" is a headline that seems to be a straightforward description of an event. It does not contain any information that goes against common sense. The image shows a person who appears to be former President Donald Trump saluting, which is a common gesture of respect or acknowledgment. The context of the salute, such as the location and the reason for the salute, is not provided in the text, but there is nothing inherently contradictory or nonsensical in the headline itself.
The text in the image states, "Max Blumenthal shows us all the COLGANE toothpaste available in Venezuela." This statement is not accurate according to the pictures provided. The image shows a man standing in front of a display of toothpaste, but the toothpaste visible in the image is not labeled as "COLGANE." The text seems to be a misinterpretation or an error, as the toothpaste in the image does not match the brand name mentioned.
The text in the image appears to be a statement from a protestor, expressing solidarity with the people of Kashmir and a desire to send a message to the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. The statement is clear and does not contain anything that goes against common sense. It is a call for peaceful protest and expression of concern for the situation in Kashmir.
The text provided in the image seems to be a sensationalized headline that is likely intended to provoke a reaction rather than accurately report an event. The headline suggests that Pakistani flags have been raised in an Indian state, which would indeed be a significant and potentially inflammatory event.  However, the image itself does not provide clear evidence of this claim. It shows a flagpole with two flags, but it is not possible to definitively identify the flags as being from Pakistan or India without a clearer view or additional context.  The text also mentions "PM Modi and ruling BJP," which could imply that the event is related to the political situation in India. However, without more information, it is not possible to determine the accuracy of the headline or the context in which the flags were raised.  In general, it is important to approach such headlines with a critical eye and to verify information from multiple sources before drawing conclusions.
The text in the image appears to be a headline from an article, but it is not clear what the content of the article is. The headline suggests that doctors with DrsCovidEthics are saying that Covid vaccines are unnecessary and ineffective, and that they should be halted in children and adolescents.  It is important to note that the statement made in the headline is not consistent with the scientific consensus on Covid-19 vaccines. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), Covid-19 vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective in preventing severe illness and death from Covid-19.  The CDC recommends Covid-19 vaccines for people of all ages, including children and adolescents, based on the available evidence. The WHO also recommends Covid-19 vaccines for all eligible individuals, including children and adolescents.  It is always advisable to consult with a healthcare professional for accurate and up-to-date information on vaccines and other health-related matters.
The image you've provided is a graphic with instructions on how to safely wear a cloth mask or face covering. The text and images seem to be consistent with common sense practices for wearing masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The instructions include:  1. Before putting on the mask, wash your hands and secure your hair away from your face. 2. Place the mask snugly over your mouth and nose. 3. Avoid touching your face & mask while using it. 4. Change your mask as soon as it gets damp or soiled. 5. Remove the mask without touching the front of it. 6. Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer after removing the mask.  These instructions are in line with public health guidelines to prevent the spread of respiratory droplets that can contain the virus causing COVID-19. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline that reads: "There is an increased risk with the new variant." This statement is consistent with common sense and scientific understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic. The emergence of new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been a concern since the beginning of the pandemic, as they can potentially increase the transmissibility and/or virulence of the disease.  The headline is attributed to Sir Patrick Vallance, the Chief Scientific Adviser, which suggests that this statement is based on scientific evidence and expert opinion. Therefore, there is nothing in the text that goes against common sense or scientific understanding of the pandemic.
The text "The proposed D model of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir, Ayodhya" is a description of a proposed design for a temple. It does not contain any information that goes against common sense. The text is a straightforward statement about a proposed architectural design for a religious structure.
The text in the image appears to be a screenshot from a social media platform, and it contains a statement that seems to be a conspiracy theory. The statement reads: "Americans attending the Wuhan Military Games are spreading the virus."  This statement goes against common sense and scientific understanding of the coronavirus pandemic. It is not supported by any credible scientific evidence or official statements from health organizations. The World Health Organization (WHO) has consistently stated that the virus was not man-made and did not originate from the United States.  The image itself shows a person on a train, and there is no clear evidence in the image that supports the claim made in the text. The image does not provide any context or evidence to back up the claim that the virus was deliberately spread by Americans attending the Wuhan Military Games.  It is important to critically evaluate information and to rely on credible sources when sharing or discussing information about public health issues.
The text provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It is a factual statement about a scientific study. The text is discussing the findings of researchers who have observed that a baby born to a partially vaccinated mother has coronavirus antibodies, which could indicate that the mother's vaccination has provided some level of protection to the baby. This is a plausible and expected outcome, as vaccines are designed to stimulate an immune response that can protect the individual receiving the vaccine, as well as potentially provide some level of protection to others, including infants.
The text in the image appears to be a meme or a piece of internet humor that is not based on factual information. It references a Breitbart column by Kris Kobach, which is known for its conservative and often controversial viewpoints. The text suggests that there was voter fraud in New Hampshire, which is a claim that has been widely debunked by election officials and fact-checking organizations.  The claim that voter fraud changed the election in New Hampshire is not supported by any credible evidence. In fact, numerous studies and investigations have found that voter fraud is extremely rare in the United States. The text in the image is likely intended to be humorous or satirical, but it is not based on any factual information.
The text in the image appears to be a headline from a newspaper, which reads: "Rollout of UK vaccine faces years of delay." This headline suggests that there may be significant delays in the rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine in the UK.  The headline is based on an article that discusses the challenges faced by the UK in its vaccine rollout, including the need for a more efficient delivery system, the potential impact of Brexit on the supply chain, and the need for a more robust public health infrastructure.  The headline does not seem to go against common sense, as it reflects the reality of the situation at the time the newspaper was published. The challenges mentioned in the headline are indeed common sense considerations for any large-scale vaccination program. However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine if the headline is accurate or if there are any inaccuracies or misleading statements in the accompanying article.
The text you provided appears to be a sensationalized headline or a statement that is not supported by any credible sources. It makes allegations about the Clinton Foundation and a cargo ship, which are not substantiated by any publicly available evidence.  The statement "BOMBSHELL Drugs, Illegal Foods For Terrorists Allegedly Found On Seized Clinton Foundation Cargo Ship" is highly speculative and does not provide any specific details or evidence to back up these claims. It is not uncommon for sensationalized headlines to be used to attract attention and generate clicks, but they often do not reflect the actual facts or circumstances.  It is important to be cautious when interpreting news headlines and to verify information from multiple credible sources before accepting it as fact.
The text "Doctors with Covid forced to treat" is not consistent with the image provided. The image shows individuals in full-body protective suits, which are commonly used in medical settings to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. It is not clear from the image whether these individuals are doctors or if they are being "forced" to treat anyone. The text seems to be a misinterpretation or an exaggeration of the situation depicted in the image.
The text in the image appears to be a summary of poll results from the New York Times/Siena College poll conducted in October 2020. It shows the results for various states, including Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The poll results indicate the percentage of support for the two major candidates at that time, Joe Biden and Donald Trump.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The poll results are presented in a straightforward manner, showing the percentage of support for each candidate in each state. The numbers are based on the data collected by the polling organization and are likely to be accurate within the margin of error for the poll.
The text provided in the image seems to be a news headline or a caption that describes an event. It mentions a lathicharge by the West Bengal Police during a Durga Pooja procession. The text does not contain anything that goes against common sense. It appears to be a factual statement about an event that took place.
The text in the image appears to be a price tag for a cut of meat, specifically a rib steak. It includes information such as the weight of the meat, the price per pound, and the total price. The text does not contain any information about a bill repealing a country-of-origin meat labeling rule. The news text in the image is not related to the price tag and does not provide any information that goes against common sense.
The image you've provided appears to be a graph titled "Total Coronavirus Cases in the United States," which shows a line graph with a logarithmic scale on the y-axis, indicating the number of cases. The x-axis represents time, with dates ranging from February 15, 2020, to March 8, 2020.  The graph does not provide information on deaths, so it does not directly contradict the statement that there are only deaths from coronavirus in the US. However, the graph does show the total number of cases, which includes both confirmed cases and recoveries.  It's important to note that the graph is a snapshot in time and does not provide real-time data. As of the date of the graph (March 8, 2020), the total number of cases in the US was indeed much higher than the number of deaths.  The statement about there being only deaths from coronavirus in the US is not accurate. The graph in the image shows the total number of cases, which includes both confirmed cases and recoveries, and does not provide information on deaths.
The text you provided seems to be a fictional or satirical scenario, as it attributes a specific action to an Italian journalist that is not consistent with the behavior of journalists or the context of a meeting with a high-ranking official like Mike Pompeo. Journalists typically do not offer food to public figures during press conferences or official meetings.  The text also mentions "dogs food," which is not a typical item that would be associated with a meeting with a politician. It's possible that the text is meant to be humorous or to make a point about the nature of journalism or the relationship between journalists and politicians. However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine the exact intent behind the text.
The text in the image appears to be in Urdu, and it reads:  "60 او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او او
The text in the image states: "COVID-19 Infection Rate (PER 100 000)". This is a measure of the number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people in a given area. The numbers provided are:  - North East: 348 - North West: 292 - London: 258 - W Midlands: 258 - Wales: 373  The text also mentions that the North East has the highest rate of COVID-19 infection in the country, which is double that of London.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The numbers are presented in a clear and straightforward manner, and the statement about the North East having the highest rate of infection is based on the data provided. The text is factual and does not contain any information that would be considered counterintuitive or contrary to common sense.
The text "Glimpses of Atal Tunnel Rohtang inaugurated by Honourable PM ji in Himachal Pradesh" seems to be a description of an event. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It appears to be a factual statement about the inauguration of the Atal Tunnel in Rohtang, Himachal Pradesh, by the Prime Minister of India.
The text in the image appears to be a statement made by a person, which is then followed by a prediction or assertion. The statement "Trump Sets Ominous Stage for November 'Im Afraid the Elections Going to be Rigged'" is a subjective opinion and does not necessarily go against common sense. However, the prediction or assertion that follows, "Im Afraid the Elections Going to be Rigged," is a statement that is not supported by evidence and is a matter of speculation.  It is important to note that the integrity of elections is a fundamental aspect of democracy, and any suggestion of rigging without evidence is a serious allegation that can undermine public trust in the electoral process. It is crucial for public figures to base their statements on facts and evidence, rather than speculation or unfounded fears.
The image appears to be a poster or advertisement related to the COVID-19 pandemic. It includes information about the availability of medical masks and the number of confirmed cases in a specific region. The text is in Thai, and there are some numbers and dates provided, which seem to be related to the pandemic situation.  From the text, it is clear that the poster is promoting the use of medical masks, which is a common sense measure to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including COVID-19. The poster also includes a call to action for people to get tested for COVID-19, which is also a common sense approach to managing the pandemic.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense in terms of public health measures. The poster is promoting practices that are widely recognized as effective in reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission.
The text "Tel Aviv city hall lights up as Lebanese flag in show of solidarity" seems to be a misinterpretation of the image. The building in the image is not lit up to resemble the Lebanese flag. Instead, it appears to be a modern building with a colorful facade, possibly a hotel or a cultural center, and there is no indication that it is lit up to represent any specific flag. The lighting on the building does not form a recognizable pattern that would resemble a flag.  The image itself shows a person walking in front of the building, and the lighting on the building is not the main focus of the photo. The lighting on the building is consistent with the building's design, which includes a grid-like pattern of lights.  The text "AFP via Getty Images" indicates that the image is from the Associated Press and was distributed by Getty Images, but it does not provide any additional context or information about the event or the location.
The text provided in the image seems to be a sensationalized description of an event, which is not consistent with the image itself. The image shows a shark jumping out of the water, but it does not depict a "Great White shark leaping through the air in front of boat tour in Australia." The text is likely meant to be dramatic and attention-grabbing, but it does not accurately describe the content of the image.  The image shows a shark jumping out of the water, which is a natural behavior for sharks, particularly when they are hunting or trying to catch prey. This behavior is not uncommon and is often observed by people on boats or in the water. The presence of people in the image suggests that this is a tourist activity, where people can observe sharks from a safe distance.  The text also mentions "boat tour in Australia," which is a common tourist activity in Australia, where people can go out on boats to see marine life, including sharks. However, the text does not provide any specific information about the location or the context of the event, which makes it difficult to verify the accuracy of the statement.  In summary, while the image shows a shark jumping out of the water, the text does not accurately describe the content of the image and appears to be sensationalized or exaggerated.
The image you've provided appears to be a screenshot of a video from a social media platform, with a red line drawn across it. The text overlay on the image seems to be a comment or a caption that is not related to the content of the video. It reads:  "Video shows former Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari in hospital in ?"  The text is incomplete and does not provide any context or information that would be considered against common sense. It seems to be a placeholder or a prompt for the viewer to fill in the missing information.  The video itself shows a man in a hospital bed, but without additional context, it's not possible to determine if this is indeed former Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari or if the video is related to his health or any other aspect of his life. The red line drawn across the video suggests that the person who edited the image does not want the video to be viewed or shared, which could be due to various reasons such as privacy concerns, copyright issues, or the content being sensitive or inappropriate.
The text in the image appears to be a statement from the White House regarding the FBI and NSA's assessment of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The statement claims that the FBI and NSA told Congress that Russia did not influence the election.  However, this statement goes against the consensus of the U.S. intelligence community and the findings of multiple investigations. The U.S. intelligence community, including the FBI and NSA, concluded in a joint assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to help Donald Trump win. This assessment was based on evidence of Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations, as well as the dissemination of disinformation through social media.  Therefore, the statement in the image is not consistent with the findings of the U.S. intelligence community and is likely to be inaccurate or misleading.
The text provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It accurately describes the image as showing a barrage of rockets from Gaza into Israel, with the Iron Dome in action, which is a missile defense system designed to intercept and destroy incoming rockets. The image and the accompanying text are consistent with what one would expect to see during a conflict between Gaza and Israel, where the Iron Dome is used to protect Israeli civilians from the rockets.
The text provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It describes a situation where Tom Hanks, who was in quarantine due to the coronavirus pandemic, was provided with a volleyball to keep him company. This is a reasonable and compassionate gesture, as it is important for individuals in isolation to have some form of entertainment and interaction to maintain their mental well-being.
The text you've provided appears to be discussing the use of face masks and physical distancing in the context of public health measures, likely in the context of a pandemic or similar health crisis. It mentions that governments have implemented restrictive policies to slow the spread of COVID-19, and that among others, face masks have been a controversial topic.  The text also discusses the potential negative effects of wearing face masks, such as the possibility of increased physical distancing due to the perception that masked individuals are less trustworthy or more likely to be sick. It suggests that this perception may lead to social distancing measures that are more stringent than necessary.  The text does not contain anything that goes against common sense in the context of public health measures. It is discussing the potential impact of face masks on social behavior and the importance of considering the potential negative effects of such measures.  It's important to note that the effectiveness of face masks in reducing the spread of respiratory viruses, such as COVID-19, is supported by a significant body of scientific evidence. While there may be some negative effects associated with wearing face masks, the overall benefits in terms of public health are generally considered to outweigh these potential drawbacks.
The text in the image appears to be a call to action for COVID-19 vaccination, encouraging people to get their walk-in vaccines. It mentions that first and second doses are available for those eligible, and that personal health numbers or appointments are not needed. It also states that anyone 12+ currently living in Fraser Health can find a location for the vaccine on the Fraser Health website.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is providing accurate information about the availability of COVID-19 vaccines and how to access them. The text is clear and informative, and it does not contain any misleading or contradictory statements.
The text you provided seems to be a summary of a news story or a statement made by a public figure. It does not contain any information that goes against common sense. The statement attributed to the president is consistent with his previous public statements, which have been criticized for not explicitly condemning white nationalism. However, it is important to note that the context of the statement and the specific circumstances surrounding the events in New Zealand are not fully addressed in the text.
The text in the image is a political statement that appears to be a comparison between the policies of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. It is not a statement of fact but rather an interpretation of their respective positions on certain issues.  The text suggests that Joe Biden has stated that he will not defund the police or take away guns, while Donald Trump has said that he will take away Social Security, Medicare, and healthcare protections for pre-existing conditions.  Whether or not these statements accurately reflect the policies of the individuals mentioned is a matter of political interpretation and public record. It is important to note that political statements can be subject to various interpretations and may not always align with the actual policies or actions of the individuals involved.  As for common sense, it is not clear what the text is implying about common sense. It seems to be using common sense as a rhetorical device to suggest that one candidate's policies are more in line with what is considered reasonable or practical by the general public. However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine the specific meaning of the text in relation to common sense.
The text you provided appears to be a headline from a news source. It describes an incident where a young girl, identified as a 19-year-old, has died after being raped by her minor cousin. The location of the incident is not specified in the text.  The headline itself does not go against common sense. It is a straightforward statement of an event that has occurred. However, the content of the headline is sensitive and may be distressing to some readers. It is important to handle such topics with care and to provide accurate and up-to-date information.
The image you've provided shows a series of illustrations of men with different beard styles, each labeled with a different type of beard. The text "Will coronavirus force Portland men to finally shave off their hipster beards?" is a humorous commentary on the potential impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the fashion trends of Portland, Oregon, which is known for its hipster culture and bearded men.  The text itself does not go against common sense. It is a playful observation about how a global pandemic might influence local fashion trends. The statement is not factual but is meant to be a light-hearted joke.
The text in the image states, "Speed-building hospitals in China." This statement is not inherently against common sense, as it is a factual observation about the construction of new hospitals in China. The image shows a construction site with multiple cranes, which supports the statement that construction is moving at an astonishing pace.  However, if one were to question the feasibility of building hospitals at such a speed, they might argue that the quality of the construction could be compromised, or that the timeline for completion is unrealistic. These are valid concerns that could be considered against common sense, but they are not inherently against common sense themselves.  It's important to note that the image and text are part of a news report, and the context of the situation, including the urgency of the coronavirus outbreak, could influence the interpretation of the statement.
The text in the image appears to be a headline or a statement about a situation in China. It reads: "Videos claim to show violent protests in China amid ChineseVirus fears."  The statement seems to be a factual observation about the content of certain videos and the context in which they were taken. It does not contain anything that goes against common sense. The statement is clear and straightforward, indicating that there are videos circulating that depict violent protests in China, and that these protests are occurring during a time of heightened concern about the ChineseVirus.  However, it's important to note that the veracity of the claims made in the videos is not addressed in the statement. It simply reports that such videos exist and are being shared.
The text in the image appears to be a weather forecast or a warning about a cyclone named Amphan. It mentions that Cyclone Amphan is expected to reach the coasts of India and Bangladesh on Wednesday with winds potentially up to 185 mph.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a typical weather forecast that provides information about the expected path and intensity of a cyclone. The text is informative and seems to be based on meteorological data and forecasting models.
The image shows a person sitting among a large quantity of vegetables, including what appears to be a significant amount of cucumbers. The text in the image is not clear enough to read, so I cannot provide any information about the content of the text.  Regarding the common sense aspect, it's important to note that the image is a photograph and may not represent a typical or common scenario. It could be a staged photo, a moment captured during a harvest, or a scene from a market or farm. Without additional context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of the situation.  If the text in the image is related to the scene, it might provide more information about the context or the person's role in the situation. However, without clear text, it's not possible to make any definitive statements about the content of the text or whether it goes against common sense.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline that reads: "BREAKING NEWS: MARINE ONE TAKING PRESIDENT TO WALTER REED MEDICAL CENTER."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward announcement of the President's travel plans. The headline is clear and informative, indicating that the President is being transported to Walter Reed Medical Center, which is a military hospital. The use of "BREAKING NEWS" suggests that the event is significant or unexpected, which is consistent with the typical use of this phrase in news reporting.
The text in the image appears to be a screenshot of a social media post with a caption that seems to be discussing a political or social issue. The text mentions "Shocking! How dare these fools burn the photos of Hindu Gods & Goddesses in the name of CAA protest? What the hell CAA has to do with Hindus? Their agenda is different & politicians of @INCIndia & @CPMspeak are nursing this. @PMOIndia @VPSecretariat"  The text is expressing a viewpoint that is critical of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the actions of certain individuals or groups. The text suggests that the CAA is not relevant to Hindus and that the protests against it are being fueled by certain political parties.  The text does not contain anything that goes against common sense in terms of the content of the post. It is a statement of opinion on a political issue. However, it is important to note that the accuracy of the information and the validity of the opinions expressed in the text are subject to interpretation and may not be universally accepted.
The text provided in the image is consistent with the visual content, which shows a group of people holding Palestinian flags and protesting in front of a building that appears to be the Israeli Consulate. The text accurately describes the scene depicted in the image. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense.
The text you provided is a statement made by a GOP lawmaker. It is not a factual statement and is likely to be a political opinion or a partisan statement. The claim that "many mass shooters end up being Democrats" is not supported by evidence and is not a factual statement. It is important to note that mass shootings are a complex issue with many contributing factors, and it is not accurate or responsible to make such a statement without evidence to back it up.
The text in the image appears to be a political statement or a campaign promise related to tax reform. It states:  "The House Republican Tax Reform Blueprint 70,4423 New full-time jobs $5,256 Increase in income for median households"  The numbers provided seem to be estimates or projections of the potential impact of the tax reform plan. The first number, 70,442, is likely a reference to the number of new full-time jobs that the plan is expected to create. The second number, $5,256, is probably an estimate of the increase in income for median households.  Without additional context, it's difficult to determine if these numbers are accurate or if they are based on realistic assumptions. However, the text does not contain any overtly contradictory or nonsensical statements that would be immediately apparent as going against common sense.  It's important to note that political statements and campaign promises often involve a degree of optimism and may not always align with the actual outcomes of policy changes. Therefore, while the text itself does not seem to contain anything that goes against common sense, the accuracy of the numbers and the effectiveness of the tax reform plan would need to be evaluated through independent analysis and fact-checking.
The image you've provided appears to be a cartoon illustration of a child with a fever, as indicated by the text "Do you think you or someone you love may have COVID?" The text seems to be a prompt or question related to the child's symptoms, which could be a sign of COVID-19 or another illness.  The text itself does not go against common sense. It is a straightforward question that could be part of a health assessment or a public health campaign. However, it's important to note that the image is a stylized representation and not a real-life scenario.  If you're asking about the accuracy of the text in relation to the image, it's not possible to determine if the child in the image actually has COVID-19 or any other illness. The image is a piece of artwork and not a real-life situation.  If you're asking about the accuracy of the text in general, it's a valid question to ask if someone is experiencing symptoms that could be associated with COVID-19. It's a responsible and common-sense approach to consider one's health and seek medical advice if necessary.

The text "Armenia's kamikadze dron was successfully destroyed by Azerbaijan's air defence forces." is a statement that seems to be a misinterpretation or a sensationalized description of an event. It is not a typical description of a drone's destruction.  The term "kamikadze" is often used to describe a person who is willing to sacrifice their own life for a cause, typically in the context of a military or war situation. However, it is not appropriate to use this term to describe a drone, which is an unmanned aerial vehicle.  Additionally, the term "kamikadze" is not commonly used to describe a drone's destruction. It is more likely that a drone would be described as having been "destroyed" or "shot down" by air defense forces.  Therefore, the text appears to be a sensationalized or misleading description of an event, and it does not align with common sense.
The text in the image appears to be a political statement, expressing a desire for a "total Hollywood strike" until "Trump resigns." The statement is likely referring to the political climate in the United States and the desire for a change in leadership.  Whether or not this statement aligns with common sense can be subjective and depends on one's political views. Some might argue that it is a reasonable expression of dissent, while others might see it as an extreme measure that does not address the underlying issues.  It's important to note that the text is a meme and is not a serious call to action. It is meant to be humorous or satirical, and it is not a legitimate news source.
The text in the image appears to be in Bengali, and it seems to be discussing a situation where a group of people is celebrating an election victory. The text mentions that BJP leaders have shared a video of people dancing with swords and guns.  The statement "BJP leaders shared a video of people dancing with swords and guns" is not inherently against common sense. However, the context of the celebration and the presence of weapons could be seen as unusual or concerning, depending on the viewer's perspective.  The presence of swords and guns in a celebratory context might raise questions about the safety of the participants and the appropriateness of using such items in a public celebration. It could also be interpreted as a display of power or intimidation, which would be against common sense and social norms.  It's important to note that without additional context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of the event or the intentions of the people involved. The image and the text are meant to convey a message, but without more information, it's not possible to assess the accuracy or the implications of the situation.
The text you provided appears to be a news headline or a description of an event. It mentions "Hitting Damascus, Syrian Defense Systems Engaging," which suggests that there has been an attack on Damascus, the capital of Syria, and that the Syrian defense systems are responding to the attack.

The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a statement related to the World Health Organization (WHO). However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine if the text goes against common sense. The headline mentions "January" and "WHO," but without more information, it's not possible to assess the accuracy or relevance of the statement.  In general, news headlines and statements should be factual and not go against common sense.

The text in the image appears to be a fact check from The New York Times, which states that President Trump falsely claimed that the United States was now exporting energy for the first time. This statement is factually incorrect. The United States has been a net exporter of energy since 2017, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Therefore, the statement made by President Trump is not supported by the facts.
The text in the image appears to be a statement about police shootings and the likelihood of unarmed victims being black. The statement is based on statistics and is likely intended to raise awareness about racial disparities in law enforcement.  The statement is not inherently against common sense, as it is based on data and research. However, it is important to note that statistics can be complex and context-dependent, and interpreting them can be subject to various perspectives.  The statement does not provide the full context of the data it is referencing, such as the source of the data, the time period it covers, and the methodology used to collect and analyze the data. Without this information, it is difficult to fully assess the accuracy and relevance of the statement.  It is also important to consider that statistics can be influenced by many factors, including the quality of data collection, the definition of "unarmed," and the specific circumstances surrounding each shooting. Therefore, while the statement may be based on data, it is important to approach such statements with a critical eye and to seek out additional information to fully understand the context and implications of the data.
The text in the image appears to be a screenshot from a video that is being shared as evidence of a real plane crash involving PIA (Pakistan International Airlines). However, the text itself contains several elements that go against common sense:  1. The text claims that the plane crash was caused by "images of plane before landing." This is an absurd and nonsensical explanation for a plane crash, as images of a plane before landing would not cause the plane to crash.  2. The text also contains a series of emojis, which are not relevant to the topic of a plane crash and do not provide any useful information.  3. The text includes a phone number, which is not appropriate to share in a context related to a plane crash, as it could potentially be used for malicious purposes.  4. The text mentions "PIA Aircraft Pk-8303," which is a specific model of aircraft, but it does not provide any context or information about the incident that would allow one to verify the authenticity of the claim.  Given these points, it is clear that the text is not a credible source of information about a real plane crash involving PIA. It is likely that the image is being shared as part of a hoax or misinformation campaign.
The text you've provided appears to be an article from a newspaper, discussing Soviet interference in the 1988 U.S. presidential campaign. The article mentions that Soviet leaders were interested in the campaign and that they had a plan to interfere, which included sending agents to the United States to gather information and potentially influence the election.  The text does not contain anything that goes against common sense. It is a historical account of a documented event, and the information presented is consistent with what is known about Soviet activities during the Cold War. The article is likely discussing the actions of the Soviet Union, which was known for its efforts to influence foreign elections and governments.  However, it's important to note that the context of the article and the specific details mentioned are not within the scope of the image you've provided.

The text is clear and does not contain any contradictory or illogical information.
The text "Arizona voters fear ballots weren't counted because they used Sharpies" is a statement that suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between using Sharpie markers to fill out ballots and the possibility that those ballots were not counted. However, this statement is not based on common sense or factual evidence.  The use of Sharpie markers to fill out ballots is a common practice in many jurisdictions, and there is no evidence to suggest that using Sharpies in this way affects the counting of ballots. The statement is likely a misinterpretation or a sensationalized headline designed to provoke concern or controversy.  In reality, the counting of ballots is typically done using optical scanners that read the marks made by ink pens or ballpoint pens. The type of ink used is not a factor that would affect the scanning process. The statement is not consistent with the way elections are conducted and counted in the United States.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a statement from a news source. It mentions that Morgan and Katie Harris of Pennsylvania voted for Trump in the past but now support Biden. This statement is consistent with the idea that people's political opinions can change over time. It is not uncommon for individuals to change their political views based on various factors such as new information, personal experiences, or a shift in their values and beliefs.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward statement about a political change of heart by two individuals.
The image you've provided appears to be a graphic or a scoreboard from a soccer match, showing a score of 4-1 in favor of a team named "Penarol" against "Dep. Maldonado." The text "Final Partido" suggests that this is the final match of a competition.  The text "Did Wisconsin count more votes than it has voters?" is not related to the soccer match or the scoreboard. It seems to be a separate statement or question that is not part of the context provided by the image.  The statement "Did Wisconsin count more votes than it has voters?" is a rhetorical question that is often used to express skepticism or disbelief about the accuracy of election results. It is not a factual statement and does not provide any information that goes against common sense.  The scoreboard itself does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It shows a score of 4-1, which is a typical outcome in a soccer match. The teams are named, and the final match of a competition is indicated.  Without additional context, it's not possible to determine if there's anything else in the image or the text that goes against common sense.
The text in the image appears to be a statement from former FBI Director James Comey, who is responding to a claim made by President Donald Trump. The statement says, "WATCH Comey fires back at Trump claim he leaked classified info He's just wrong."  The statement itself does not go against common sense. It is a straightforward assertion by Comey that he did not leak classified information. However, the context of the statement and the nature of the claim made by Trump are subject to interpretation and may involve complex political and legal issues.  It is important to note that the image is a composite of two separate photographs, and the text is overlaid on the image. The text is not part of the original photographs and is added for the purpose of the composite image.
The text in the image appears to be a humorous or satirical statement, suggesting that President Trump presented President Mozzarella with a red hat that says "MAKE ITALY GRATE AGAIN." The phrase "MAKE ITALY GRATE AGAIN" is a play on words, referencing the slogan "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN" that was associated with President Trump's presidential campaign.  The text is not factual and is likely meant to be a joke or a commentary on political slogans. It does not reflect any actual event or statement made by President Trump. The phrase "President Mozzarella" is also not a real person and is likely a fictional or symbolic character used for comedic effect.
The text in the image appears to be a screenshot of a social media post with a caption that seems to be discussing a political or social issue. The text mentions "Shocking! How dare these fools burn the photos of Hindu Gods & Goddesses in the name of CAA protest? What the hell CAA has to do with Hindus? Their agenda is different & politicians of @INCIndia & @CPMspeak are nursing this. @PMOIndia @VPSecretariat"  The text is expressing a viewpoint that is critical of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the actions of certain individuals or groups. The text suggests that the CAA is not relevant to Hindus and that the protests against it are being fueled by certain political parties.  The text does not contain anything that goes against common sense in terms of the content of the post. It is a statement of opinion on a political issue. However, it is important to note that the accuracy of the information and the validity of the opinions expressed in the text are subject to interpretation and may not be universally accepted.
The text in the image appears to be a statement made by a person, likely a politician or a public figure, during a press conference or a similar event. The statement seems to be a commentary on a geopolitical situation, specifically the situation in Syria involving US-led forces.  Without additional context, it's difficult to determine if the statement goes against common sense. However, the statement itself does not inherently contradict common sense. It is a statement that could be interpreted in various ways depending on one's perspective on the situation in Syria and the role of US-led forces in the region.  It's important to note that the statement is just one part of the image and that the context of the event and the person's intentions are not fully clear from the image alone. Therefore, it's not possible to make a definitive judgment about the statement's accuracy or its alignment with common sense.
The text in the image suggests that a Bible and a statue of Jesus were placed in the shelf behind Sonia Gandhi, who is a prominent Indian politician. The image shows two photos of the same scene, with the top photo labeled "VIRAL IMAGE" and the bottom photo labeled "VIDEO BY CONGRESS."  The text in the image is a bit confusing and seems to be a mix of statements that are not directly related to the images. It mentions "Bhakts" (a term often used in India to refer to devout followers of Hinduism) and "placed a Bible and a statue of Jesus in the shelf behind Sonia Gandhi."  The statement about the Bible and the statue of Jesus being placed in the shelf behind Sonia Gandhi is not consistent with the images provided. The images show a bookshelf with various books, but there is no visible Bible or statue of Jesus on the shelf.  The text also mentions "Sonia Gandhi," but the images do not provide any context or information about her. The text seems to be trying to make a point about the religious beliefs of the Bhakts, but the images do not support the claim made in the text.  Overall, the text appears to be a misleading or inaccurate statement, as it does not correspond to the visual content of the images.
The text in the image appears to be a headline or a title for a video or article. It reads: "Tabrez Ansari mob lynching CASE TIMELINE."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense.

The numbers are presented in a clear and organized manner, and there's nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The figures are likely based on official reports or data from reliable sources.  The infographic also includes a map showing the geographical distribution of the virus, which is a common way to visualize the spread of a disease. The map is color-coded to indicate the number of cases in each area, which is a standard method for representing data in a visual format.  The text at the bottom of the image provides additional context, mentioning the Syrian Ministry of Health and the Autonomous Administration Syrian Interim Government, which are the entities responsible for health matters in Syria.

The text you provided states that the image is the "First photograph of earth, sent by Chandrayan." This statement is not accurate according to common sense and scientific knowledge.  The Chandrayaan mission, launched by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), is a lunar mission that sent a spacecraft to the Moon. The primary objective of the mission was to study the Moon's surface and composition, as well as to search for water ice. The spacecraft, named Chandrayaan-1, was equipped with several scientific instruments, including a high-resolution camera.  However, the camera on Chandrayaan-1 was not designed to take photographs of the Earth from the Moon's orbit. The primary focus of the camera was to study the lunar surface, and it was not capable of taking high-resolution images of Earth from such a distance.  Therefore, the statement that the image is the "First photograph of earth, sent by Chandrayan" is incorrect. The image you've provided is not from the Chandrayaan mission and does not depict the Earth as seen from the Moon.

The text in the image provides advice on how to stay safe during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The text also includes a call to action, urging people to take responsibility for their own health and the health of others by following these precautions. This message is consistent with the recommendations of health organizations worldwide.  Therefore, the text does not contain anything that goes against common sense in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The graphic also includes the number of electoral votes each candidate won in Michigan, which is 16 for Biden and 13 for Trump.

The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a statement from a news source. It mentions that police have arrested children from a madrasa in Raja Bazar, Kolkata, and that the children are being trained to become terrorists for self-destruction. The statement also mentions that media personnel are not allowed to show the children's faces due to lack of orders from seniors.  The statement that "Most of the madrasas in India have similar training" is a generalization that may not be accurate or representative of the situation. It is important to note that the statement is not supported by any evidence or data provided in the image.  The claim that children are being trained to become terrorists is a serious allegation that would require substantial evidence to support. It is not appropriate to make such allegations without proper investigation and verification.  In general, it is important to approach news sources with a critical eye and to verify information from multiple sources before accepting it as fact.
The text in the image appears to be a fabricated or misleading statement, as it attributes a statement to the AIUDF Chief Badruddin Ajmal that is not accurate. The statement claims that Ajmal said, "India will become an Islamic nation if Congress-AIUDF alliance is voted to power in Assam." This statement is not consistent with the known political stance of the AIUDF, which is a political party in India that is part of the United Democratic Front (UDF) and has been involved in various alliances with other political parties.  The AIUDF has not made such a statement, and the claim is likely intended to create fear or controversy. It is important to verify the accuracy of political statements and to be cautious about sharing or spreading information that is not credible or has been manipulated.

The text in the image states, "Trump again falsely claims he opposed the Iraq War before the invasion." This statement is factual and does not go against common sense.

The image you've provided appears to be a graph showing the proportion of patients spending over 4 hours in A&E (Accident and Emergency) departments in the UK, broken down by month from January 2011 to December 2018.

From the graph, we can observe that the proportion of patients spending over 4 hours in A&E has generally increased over the years, with some fluctuations. The highest percentage of patients spending over 4 hours is shown in the month of October 2018, which is marked with a green color, indicating that over 3.5% of patients spent over 4 hours in A&E that month.  There is nothing in the text or the graph that goes against common sense. The graph accurately represents the data, and the text provides a clear and concise description of the data presented. The information is consistent with what one would expect to see in a report or news article about the state of healthcare services in the UK.
The text provided in the image does not go against common sense. It clarifies that the location of the crocodile rescue is in Chiplun, not Dadar in Mumbai. This is an important correction because the original description of the location was incorrect, which could lead to confusion or misinformation. The text also mentions that the crocodile was found in a gutter, which is an unusual place for a crocodile to be found, especially in an urban area like Mumbai. This information is consistent with the image, which shows a person pulling a crocodile out of a gutter.
The text in the image appears to be a handwritten note that says "TV FF." This does not seem to be related to the content of the image, which shows a hospital setting with medical equipment and personnel. The note does not provide any information that goes against common sense or contradicts scientific consensus.  Regarding the statement "Scientists say COVID can lead to brain damage," this is a widely accepted scientific finding. COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, can indeed lead to various neurological complications, including brain damage, particularly in severe cases. This is supported by numerous studies and reports from health authorities worldwide.
The text you provided seems to be a sensationalized or misleading headline. It is not appropriate to make assumptions about the content of the image based on a headline without context.

The text is consistent with what can be observed in the image.

The text in the images appears to be a political statement, and it seems to be using a photo of Cynthia Patag to convey a message. The text includes phrases like "vote straight OTSOS," "never again," and "doctor image," which are likely referring to political candidates or parties. The phrase "doctor image" is particularly unusual, as it doesn't make sense in the context of a political statement. It's possible that it's a typo or a mistake in the text.  The rest of the text seems to be a call to action, urging people to vote straight for a particular party or candidate. The use of a photo of a public figure to promote a political message is a common tactic in political campaigns, but the specific message and the context in which it's being used are not clear from the image alone.  Without additional context, it's difficult to determine if the text goes against common sense. However, the use of a photo of a public figure to promote a political message could be seen as manipulative or disrespectful, depending on the context and the intentions of the person or group using the image.
The text in the image appears to be a price tag for a cut of meat, specifically a rib steak. It includes information such as the weight of the meat, the price per pound, and the total price.

The news text in the image is not related to the price tag and does not provide any information that goes against common sense.
The text in the image is a warning from Public Health England about the potential dangers of face masks for young children. It states that face masks can cause choking and suffocation for children under three.

It is important for parents and caregivers to be aware of these risks and to follow the guidance provided by health authorities to ensure the safety of young children.
The text in the image appears to be a statement made by President Trump during a speech. The statement is about the Democratic Party's stance on abortion, suggesting that they are in favor of abortion even after the birth of a child. This is a controversial and polarizing issue, and opinions on it vary widely.  Whether or not the statement is accurate or goes against common sense depends on one's perspective on the issue of abortion. Some people might argue that the statement is an exaggeration or misrepresentation of the Democratic Party's position on abortion, while others might agree with the statement based on their understanding of the party's platform.  It's important to note that the statement is a political one, and political statements often involve hyperbole and simplifications for the purpose of persuasion or to highlight a particular point of view. Therefore, whether the statement goes against common sense or not is subjective and depends on one's political and moral beliefs.

The text "Dr." is a common title for medical professionals, so it's not unusual to see it in this context. If there's a specific part of the text you're referring to, please provide more details, and I can comment further.
The text in the image appears to be a congratulatory message for Sonu Sood receiving an award from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for his humanitarian efforts.

The text in the image discusses the idea of a universal basic income (UBI) as a potential solution to economic challenges, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The text mentions that economists Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee argue that a UBI could revitalize damaged economies.  The text does not present anything that goes against common sense. It is a well-structured article discussing the economic implications of a UBI, which is a policy proposal that has been debated for many years. The idea of providing a basic income to all citizens, regardless of their employment status, is a concept that has gained traction in recent years as a way to address income inequality and provide a safety net for those who are struggling financially.  The image accompanying the text shows a silhouette of a person standing between two chairs, which could symbolize the idea of a UBI providing a stable base for people's financial well-being, much like the chairs provide support and stability.  Overall, the text and image present a coherent argument for the potential benefits of a UBI, which aligns with common sense in the context of economic policy discussions.
The text in the image appears to be in Hindi and is discussing the actions of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his colleagues. The text seems to be making a point about the inconsistency of their actions, suggesting that they are not following the same health guidelines that they are promoting for others.  However, without a clear understanding of the context or the specific content of the text, it's difficult to determine if the text is making a valid point or if it's misleading or inaccurate. It's important to critically evaluate the information presented in such images and texts, as they can sometimes be misleading or taken out of context.  Regarding the image itself, it shows a person, presumably Arvind Kejriwal, assisting a child with a mask. The child is wearing a mask, which is a good practice for health and safety, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The adults in the image are not wearing masks, which could be a concern if they are in a public setting where masks are recommended or required.  It's worth noting that the image does not provide enough context to determine the exact circumstances or the reasons why the adults are not wearing masks. They could be in a private setting where masks are not required, or they might be taking a break from wearing masks. Without more information, it's not possible to make a definitive statement about the situation.
The text in the image appears to be in Hindi, and it seems to be a news headline or a caption from a news program. The text mentions that the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) has found the location of the Vikram Lander on the lunar surface.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward announcement of a significant achievement by ISRO. The Vikram Lander is part of the Chandrayaan-2 mission, which aimed to land on the moon's surface. The news is reporting that the location of the lander has been identified, which is a crucial step in understanding the mission's outcome and potentially recovering the lander.
The text in the image states: "COVID-19: Brazilian politics slow vaccine progress." This statement is consistent with common sense and is based on the fact that political disputes can indeed slow down the progress of important initiatives, such as the development and distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine. The image shows a person receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, which is a positive development in the fight against the pandemic. The text accurately reflects the situation in Brazil, where political tensions have been reported to have an impact on the country's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The text in the image appears to be a headline or a statement that is meant to be informative or to clarify a situation. It does not contain anything that goes against common sense.

The text does not contain any information that would be considered out of the ordinary or contradictory to common sense.
The text in the image appears to be a warning or announcement, possibly from a mosque, regarding an impending attack on Hindus in the area. The statement "Hindus becoming refugee in their own country" suggests that there is a perceived threat to the safety and security of Hindus in the region.  The statement "Bagakhali, Diamond harbour, South Paraganas, West Bengal announcement from masjid to attack Hindu" indicates that the announcement is specific to a particular location and community.  The text does not contain anything that goes against common sense in terms of the content of the message. However, the message itself is alarming and suggests a potential conflict or tension between different religious communities in the area. It is important to note that such announcements can contribute to fear and mistrust among different communities, and can potentially escalate tensions and conflicts.
The image you've provided appears to be an infographic or poster with various prevention tips for the Coronavirus (COVID-19). The tips are presented in a visual format with icons and illustrations.

The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a caption from a video, and it reads: "2020-03-31 TT2 25:51 AXON BODY 2 X8101738." This text seems to be a timestamp and a reference code for a video or a news report, and it does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It is a technical detail that is not meant to convey any specific message or information.
The text in the image appears to be a screenshot from a video, possibly a thumbnail or a still from a video. The text is in Korean, and it reads "런덤 인터뷰 V," which translates to "Random Interview V" in English. The text is not in English, and it does not contain any information about Chinese bombers or any other unconfirmed reports. The text seems to be related to a video interview, possibly a vlog or a podcast episode, rather than a news report.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a social media post. It mentions that Sonu Sood has received an award for his humanitarian efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic. The award is the SDG Special Humanitarian Action Award by the UNDP. The text also mentions that Sonu Sood sent lakhs of migrant workers home and aided in free education.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a factual statement about an individual's actions and the recognition he has received for those actions. The text is clear and does not contain any information that would be considered unusual or counterintuitive.
The text in the image appears to be a headline or a statement related to the coronavirus situation in the UK. It mentions a year-old child who has died from COVID, which is a tragic event. However, the text does not provide any information that goes against common sense. It is a factual statement about a recent event.  It is important to note that the context of the image and the source of the information are not provided, so it is not possible to verify the accuracy of the statement. It is always advisable to cross-check information from multiple reliable sources before accepting it as fact.
The text in the image states, "There is no proof of widespread voter fraud in New Hampshire." This statement is consistent with common sense and is supported by the fact that numerous studies and investigations have found little to no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the United States, including in New Hampshire.
The text "PM Jawaharlal Nehru Arrives In USA , Inspecting Guard of Honour by American Armed Forces" is consistent with the image provided. The image shows a group of individuals in military uniforms, which suggests they are part of a guard of honor. The presence of a person in a suit, who appears to be a dignitary, inspecting the guard of honor is also consistent with the text.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The text accurately describes the scene depicted in the image.
The text in the image appears to be a quote from a news source, discussing the media's coverage of American deaths in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The quote suggests that the media would like everyone to believe that the number of deaths reported in the United States remains high, despite the fact that the world has recorded 5 million deaths from the Wuhan virus.  The statement that "the media would like everyone to believe" is a subjective interpretation and not a factual statement. It implies that the media is intentionally misleading the public, which is a serious accusation. However, without additional context or evidence, it is not possible to determine the accuracy of this statement.  The rest of the text seems to be a factual statement about the number of deaths reported in the United States and the global context of the pandemic. It is not clear from the image alone whether the text is accurate or not, as it is a screenshot and not the original source.  It is important to critically evaluate news sources and their reporting, especially in times of crisis, to ensure that the information being presented is accurate and not misleading.
The text "Caught on camera Autonomous robot destroyed by selfdriving Tesla" is a humorous and exaggerated statement that goes against common sense. It suggests that a robot, which is typically designed to be autonomous and self-sufficient, was destroyed by a self-driving Tesla, which is a vehicle designed for human use. This is an absurd and fictional scenario, as robots and self-driving cars do not have the capability to interact with each other in such a manner. The text is likely meant to be a joke or a creative way to describe a situation, rather than a literal event.
The image depicts four individuals wearing masks, which is a common practice to prevent the spread of respiratory droplets, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The text "Maskwearing and respiratory health Is your body getting enough oxygen?" is a question that suggests the concern that wearing masks might reduce oxygen intake.  However, the image and the text together do not provide enough information to determine if the body is getting enough oxygen. The text is a general question about respiratory health, which is not directly related to the image of people wearing masks. The image does not provide any information about the individuals' respiratory health or oxygen levels.  In general, wearing masks does not reduce the amount of oxygen that a person receives. The body's need for oxygen is met by the blood, which carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. The air we breathe is not the only source of oxygen; the body also produces oxygen through the process of cellular respiration.  Therefore, the text does not go against common sense, as it is a valid question about respiratory health. However, the image and the text together do not provide a comprehensive answer to the question posed by the text.
The text "Stone pelting on school bus in Seelampur" suggests an act of violence or vandalism, which is not a common occurrence in everyday life. It is unusual for a school bus to be targeted with such an act, as buses are typically used for transporting students and are not considered a target for such behavior. The fact that this event is described as "common sense" is likely a typographical error or a misinterpretation of the situation.
The text in the image appears to be in Bengali, and it reads: "অন্যান্য কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে কান্ডে ক
The text provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It accurately describes a large gathering of people in Yangon, Myanmar, who are protesting for democracy, the release of detained leaders, and an end to dictatorship. The image shows a massive crowd of people, which supports the statement that "hundreds of thousands of people are protesting." The text is consistent with what one would expect to see in a situation where a significant number of people are participating in a protest or demonstration.
The text in the image appears to be a call to action for solidarity with students at JNU (Jawaharlal Nehru University) who are fighting for their right to education. It mentions that the students are protesting against the destruction of public education and the privatization of education. The text also provides a phone number for people to call for support.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a clear and direct call for people to support a cause that is related to education and the rights of students. The text is informative and seems to be promoting a peaceful form of protest.
The text in the image appears to be a statement about the impact of tax cuts on different income groups. It suggests that while the GOP's tax cuts might be marketed as benefiting the middle class, they could actually result in higher taxes for working people. This statement is consistent with the data presented in the bar chart, which shows that the percentage change in after-tax income for the bottom 20% of income earners is negative, indicating a decrease in after-tax income.  The statement is not inherently against common sense, as it is based on the data provided in the chart. However, it is important to note that the interpretation of tax policy and its impact on different income groups can be complex and subject to various economic and policy factors. The statement is likely to be controversial and could be interpreted differently by different individuals based on their political and economic views.
The text in the image appears to be a statement from the White House regarding the FBI and NSA's assessment of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The statement claims that the FBI and NSA told Congress that Russia did not influence the election.  However, this statement goes against the consensus of the U.S. intelligence community and the findings of multiple investigations. The U.S. intelligence community, including the FBI and NSA, concluded in a joint assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to help Donald Trump win. This assessment was based on evidence of Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations, as well as the dissemination of disinformation through social media.  Therefore, the statement in the image is not consistent with the findings of the U.S. intelligence community and is likely to be inaccurate or misleading.
The image shows a bottle of Crown Royal whiskey with a spray nozzle attached to it.

The text provided in the image appears to be a news headline or a caption that reads, "Pakistani flag waived in Srinagar during protest demonstration." This statement seems to be a factual observation of an event that took place in Srinagar, which is a city in the Indian-administered region of Jammu and Kashmir.  The statement does not go against common sense, as it accurately describes an event that has been widely reported in the media. The presence of a crowd of people, some of whom are holding flags, is consistent with the nature of protest demonstrations, where participants often express their political or social views through the display of flags or other symbols.  It is important to note that the image itself is a still from a video, and without additional context, it is not possible to determine the exact nature of the protest or the specific circumstances surrounding the event. However, the statement provided in the image is consistent with what one would expect to see in a news report or a caption describing a protest demonstration.
The text provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense.

These are areas where many people feel strongly about preserving or expanding services, and the text reflects that sentiment.

The text is consistent with what one would expect to read in a news report about a significant announcement by a public health official.
The text in the image appears to be a warning about a chicken being infected with the coronavirus. However, it is important to note that the image shows a chicken with a skin condition, which is not necessarily related to the coronavirus. The text also mentions "corona virus found in Bangalore today," which is not accurate as the coronavirus is a global pandemic and not specific to Bangalore.  The claim that the chicken is infected with the coronavirus is not supported by any scientific evidence or official health statements. It is also not clear how a chicken could be infected with the coronavirus, as the virus primarily affects humans and other mammals.  Therefore, the text in the image goes against common sense and is not based on accurate information. It is important to rely on credible sources for information about health and safety, and to avoid spreading misinformation.
The text in the image is a quote attributed to Joe Biden, which reads: "What? I don't know what I'm signing here." This statement is often used to humorously express confusion or ignorance about a document or agreement that one is signing.

The quote is a relatable and light-hearted way to express such feelings.
The text in the image appears to be a screenshot from a video, and it seems to be discussing a topic related to farmers' protests in India. The text mentions that Punjab, Haryana, and Western Uttar Pradesh will have the maximum action, which could imply that these regions will see the most significant protests or events related to the topic being discussed.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward statement about the geographical areas where the action is expected to be the most intense. However, without additional context, it's not possible to determine the accuracy or relevance of the statement to the current situation.
The text provided does not seem to go against common sense. It describes an event where people have been affected by an explosion, and they are being attended to in a hospital setting. The presence of medical personnel and the condition of the patients suggest that this is a serious situation that requires immediate attention and care. The text does not contain any information that would be considered unusual or counterintuitive.

The statement is about Prince Philip, who is the husband of Queen Elizabeth II. The text says that Prince Philip has experienced a great emptiness, according to Prince Andrew.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a statement that is likely to be taken seriously by those who follow the British monarchy, as it is a personal reflection from a member of the royal family. The statement is consistent with the idea that people can experience a wide range of emotions, including feelings of emptiness or loss.
The text in the image states: "This year especially, the Coronavirus pandemic is challenging our communities in ways we could never have imagined, and it's leaving vulnerable children at greater risk than ever before."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense.

The text is a call to action, recognizing the challenges faced by these communities and emphasizing the need for support and protection.
The text in the image appears to be a statement from the Malaysian government regarding tax rates for households earning less than RMk. The statement is as follows:  "Budget Tax rates for households earning less than RMk to be reduced"  There is nothing in this text that goes against common sense. It is a clear and straightforward announcement that the government is planning to reduce tax rates for households with income below a certain threshold, which is RMk. This is a common practice in many countries to provide relief to lower-income earners.
The image shows a piece of paper with flight information, which appears to be from an Ethiopian Airlines flight. The text on the paper includes the flight number, departure time, and destination. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense; it seems to be a standard flight itinerary. The context provided by the news text indicates that the paper is from the site where the Ethiopian Airlines flight ET crashed, which is a tragic event. However, the text on the paper itself does not contain any information that would be considered unusual or against common sense.
The text provided in the image does not go against common sense. It states that the explosion in Beirut was caused by an estimated 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate left unsecured in a warehouse. This is a plausible explanation for the explosion, as ammonium nitrate is a highly explosive substance when improperly stored or mishandled. The presence of such a large quantity of ammonium nitrate in a warehouse without proper security measures in place is indeed a cause for concern and could potentially lead to a catastrophic explosion.
The text you provided seems to be a statement made by a midfielder named Felipe Melo, who is discussing a tactic used by the Brazilian national team against Argentina. The statement suggests that Brazil rotated their fouling on Lionel Messi during their matches, which is a common tactic in football to disrupt an opposing player's performance.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a factual statement about a tactic that has been employed in professional football. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of such tactics can be debated, as some might argue that it is unsportsmanlike or against the spirit of the game.
The text in the image appears to be a statement about the number of murders in Chicago over a weekend. It reads: "Rudy Giuliani Wildly Wrong in Partisan Tweet About Murders in Chicago This Weekend."  The statement seems to be a critique of a tweet made by Rudy Giuliani, which is suggesting that the number of murders in Chicago over a weekend is high. The text implies that Giuliani's statement is inaccurate or misleading, which could be considered going against common sense if the statement is indeed false or misleading.  However, without more context or information about the specific tweet in question, it's difficult to determine if the statement is accurate or not. It's also worth noting that the text is a headline or a summary of an article, which may not provide the full context of the situation.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline from Reuters. It states: "BREAKING NEWS: JUST IN UK alongside European allies now recognizes Juan Guaido as interim constitutional president in Venezuela until credible elections can be held Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt on Twitter."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The headline is reporting a political development where the United Kingdom and some European countries have recognized Juan Guaido as the interim president of Venezuela, following his declaration of the position. This is a legitimate action for foreign governments to take when they believe the elected leader is not fulfilling their duties or when there is a dispute over the legitimacy of the elected leader. The headline is providing information about a current event, which is consistent with journalistic standards.
The text "Plane Crashed CCTV Karachi PK PIACrash" appears to be a description of an event, specifically a plane crash in Karachi, Pakistan, as captured by a CCTV camera. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward statement of an incident that has occurred.
The text you provided seems to be a humorous or fictional scenario, as it suggests that Russia has produced the world's first batch of COVID vaccines for animals and that a cat named Kasha was one of the first to receive a jab. This is not a real event and goes against common sense because it is not scientifically or ethically sound to vaccinate animals against a disease that primarily affects humans. Additionally, the image you've provided does not show a cat being vaccinated; it appears to be a normal interaction between a cat and a person, with no indication of a vaccination taking place.
The text in the image appears to be a mix of unrelated statements and what seems to be a name. It does not provide any information that goes against common sense. The statements are not coherent or logical, which is not uncommon for nonsensical text. The name "Nusrat Jahan" is mentioned, but without additional context, it's unclear how it relates to the image or the text.
The image shows a news anchor on a television screen, and the text on the screen indicates that the news segment is about Norah O'Donnell, who is a well-known journalist and news anchor. The text also mentions "CBS Evening News," which is a legitimate news program.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The text is providing information about a news segment, which is a standard practice for news broadcasts. The text is clear and informative, and there are no statements or claims that are obviously false or contradictory to common sense.
The text you provided is a statement attributed to Joe Biden, and it appears to be a direct quote from a news source. The statement is about Elizabeth Warren's Medicare for All plan and suggests that it would require a trillion-dollar tax hike on the middle class.  Whether or not this statement is accurate or goes against common sense would depend on the context of the plan and the specifics of the taxation proposal. It's important to consider the source of the information and the credibility of the news outlet. Additionally, the statement should be evaluated in light of the broader policy discussion and the potential implications for taxpayers and the healthcare system.  It's worth noting that political statements can be subject to interpretation and may not always align with the perspectives of all individuals. Therefore, it's crucial to critically evaluate such statements and consider multiple sources of information when forming an opinion on political matters.

The text is clear and does not contain any information that contradicts basic understanding of public health guidelines during a pandemic.
The text "India found its missing Vikram lunar lander" is a statement that seems to be in line with common sense, as it reports a significant event in space exploration. The Vikram lunar lander is indeed a spacecraft that was sent by India to the Moon, and it was reported missing after a hard landing on the lunar surface. The statement that India found the lander is consistent with the fact that such a discovery would be a major achievement for the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and the global space community.  However, without additional context or information, it's not possible to determine the accuracy of the statement. It's important to verify such news reports with reliable sources to ensure that the information is accurate and not misleading.
The text in the image states, "TRUMP WINS FLORIDA 223 BIDEN, 174 TRUMP." This statement is not accurate according to the official results of the 2020 United States presidential election. As of the time of the image, Joe Biden won the state of Florida with 49.7% of the votes, while Donald Trump received 49.1% of the votes. Therefore, the text in the image goes against common sense and the official election results.
The image shows a man speaking at what appears to be a political event. The text overlay on the image includes the phrase "Joe Biden is a nasty man."

The text in the image appears to be a political slogan or campaign message, which is not necessarily a false claim. However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine the accuracy or veracity of the statement. It seems to be a call to action or a statement of intent, which is common in political discourse.  The text is in Portuguese and reads: "VOTEM NA BIANCA O PRIOR SAÍ DEPOIS!!!" This translates to "Vote for the Bianca candidate before the prior one leaves!!!" The message is likely intended to encourage people to vote for a particular candidate named Bianca before another candidate leaves the race.  Without more information about the context of the message, the identity of the candidates, or the specific circumstances surrounding the message, it's not possible to determine if the statement is false or not. It's important to verify information from reliable sources before sharing it or relying on it.

However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine the accuracy of the statement or the source of the information.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a summary of a news story. It reads: "FOR LIVE COVERAGE AND UPDATES DOWNLOAD THE FREE APP AT CBSNEWS.COM/APP."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward announcement for viewers to access live coverage and updates on a news story by downloading the CBS News app. The text is clear and does not contain any information that would be considered unusual or counterintuitive.
The text in the image states, "This yearold man is busy installing an elevator into his home so that he can grow old in his current house as long as he can."  The statement "This yearold man" is likely a typographical error or a misinterpretation of the image, as it is unusual for a man to be described as a "yearold" in this context. It is more likely that the man is described as a "young man" or a "man in his youth."  The rest of the statement seems to be a reasonable explanation for the man's actions. Installing an elevator in a home can be a practical solution for someone who wants to age in place and maintain their independence as they get older. It allows for easier movement within the home, which can be particularly beneficial for individuals with mobility issues.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense.

The image shows a group of people holding up a flag with a star and crescent design, which is commonly associated with the flag of Pakistan. The text in the image appears to be in Urdu, and it reads "جمپ" which translates to "gathering" or "assembly" in English.  Without additional context, it's difficult to determine if there's anything in the text that goes against common sense. The text seems to be a simple statement about a gathering or assembly, which doesn't inherently contradict common sense. However, if there's a specific part of the text that you're questioning, please provide more details or clarify what aspect you're referring to.
The text in the image appears to be a protest banner, and it seems to be written in Bengali. The text translates to: "Massive protest procession of Bangladesh JamaateIslami Chittagong metropolis in France in protest of insulting the Holy Prophet Muhammad PBUH."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a clear statement of the purpose of the protest, which is to express dissent against an action perceived as disrespectful to the Prophet Muhammad. The text is straightforward and does not contain any contradictory or nonsensical statements.
The image you've provided appears to show a vehicle on a road with a cloudy sky in the background. There is no visible airplane or any indication of a recent plane crash in the image. The text "Recent Ethiopian plane crash inside and external pics and video" does not correspond to the content of the image. It seems to be a misleading or incorrect statement, as there is no evidence of a plane crash in the image provided.
The text in the image appears to be a statement made by a person during a televised interview or discussion. The statement is about the Clinton Foundation and the percentage of funds that go to charitable causes.  The statement "Pence wrongly says only cents of every dollar from Clinton Foundation goes to charity" suggests that the person being interviewed, Mike Pence, is making an incorrect or misleading statement about the Clinton Foundation's charitable giving.  However, without additional context or information, it's not possible to determine the accuracy of the statement. It's important to note that statements made during media appearances can sometimes be misleading or inaccurate, and it's always a good idea to verify information from multiple sources before drawing conclusions.
The text in the image is discussing the Department of Health's recommendation for the use of flu and pneumonia vaccines to prevent COVID-19 complications. It mentions that the Department of Health is recommending the use of flu and pneumonia vaccines to prevent the additional complications from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The text is providing information about the Department of Health's recommendations, which is a standard practice for public health organizations to provide guidance on health-related matters. The text is not making any claims that are contrary to common sense or scientific understanding.
The image shows a person being lifted in the air by two others, and there is a text overlay that reads "FACT? CHECK HOAX SLAYER." This suggests that the image may have been shared with the intention of debunking a false claim or rumor. The text does not provide any specific information about the person being lifted or the context of the image.  The text "FACT? CHECK HOAX SLAYER" is a call to action for viewers to verify the authenticity of the image and the claims being made about it. This is a common practice in the digital age, where misinformation can spread rapidly.  Without additional context, it's not possible to determine if the person being lifted is a wrestler named Priya Malik or if she won gold for India at the Tokyo Olympics. The image alone does not provide enough information to confirm these details.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline that reads: "BREAKING NEWS: MARINE ONE TAKING PRESIDENT TO WALTER REED MEDICAL CENTER."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward announcement of the President's travel plans. The headline is clear and informative, indicating that the President is being transported to Walter Reed Medical Center, which is a military hospital located in Bethesda, Maryland.
The image you've provided appears to be a political cartoon, which is a form of satire that uses humor or exaggeration to comment on current events or political issues. The cartoon is making a statement about the political stance of a certain individual, which is a common practice in political cartoons.  The text in the cartoon includes phrases like "Make America Hate Again," "World Opinion," and "Third Times a Charm." These phrases are likely meant to be humorous or critical, reflecting the cartoonist's perspective on the individual's policies or actions.  The statement "Trump wants to take the oil in Iraq" is a simplification of a complex geopolitical issue. It is true that the United States has had a long history of involvement in Iraq, often related to oil resources. However, the cartoon is likely using this statement as a metaphor or a shorthand way to represent the broader context of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East.  Whether or not the statement "Trump wants to take the oil in Iraq" is factually accurate is not the point of the cartoon. The cartoon is using this statement as a part of its satirical commentary.
The text you provided appears to be a statement from a news outlet, C-SPAN, reporting on an event. The statement is about a woman who spoke at a town hall event with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC). The woman is described as having made a controversial statement about eating babies to address climate change.  The statement "Woman at AOC Town Hall Who Pitched Eating Babies as Solution to Climate Crisis Was Plant from ProTrump Group" is not part of the original C-SPAN news text. It seems to be an additional commentary or speculation, possibly from a different source or a social media post, that is not supported by the information provided by C-SPAN.  The statement about the woman being a plant from a pro-Trump group is not based on any evidence presented in the C-SPAN news text. It is an unsubstantiated claim that goes against common sense, as it implies that the woman was intentionally placed at the event to make a controversial statement, which is not a typical behavior for someone attending a public event.  It is important to critically evaluate news sources and be cautious about accepting unsubstantiated claims as fact.
The text provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It describes a group of people, presumably CPIM Rajya Sabha MPs, visiting farmers protesting against Bills in different districts of Haryana. The text is consistent with what can be observed in the image, which shows a group of individuals, some of whom are wearing masks, gathered outdoors, with some holding flags and others sitting on chairs. The presence of a building in the background suggests that this gathering might be taking place in a public space or near a government or party office. The text accurately reflects the visual content of the image.
The text you provided seems to be a statement about a tragic event, but it contains several elements that go against common sense:  1. The text claims that Pragya Mishra was murdered in broad daylight. However, the image shows a person lying on the ground with blood on their clothes, which does not necessarily indicate that they were murdered. It could be a result of an accident or a medical emergency.  2. The text attributes the death to the person talking about the Kumbh Mela in the era of the coronavirus. This is a baseless claim without any evidence to support it. It is not logical to assume that someone's death is directly related to their profession or the topic they were discussing.  3. The text mentions AliRuhi and Arvind Yadav, but it does not provide any context or evidence to support the claim that they were involved in the death of Pragya Mishra.  4. The text refers to NDTV, which is a news organization, but it does not provide any information about why NDTV would be involved in the death of Pragya Mishra.  5. The text does not provide any credible sources or evidence to support the claims made.  In summary, the text contains several unsubstantiated claims and does not provide any evidence to support the assertion that Pragya Mishra was murdered because she
The text in the image reads: "Since the start of July, nearly 127,000 people have died from COVID-19."  This statement is factual and does not go against common sense. It is based on data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other reliable sources, which have been widely reported in the media. The number of deaths from COVID-19 has been increasing globally, and this statement reflects the current state of the pandemic.
The text in the image appears to be a meme or a piece of satire, and it contains a statement that is not supported by any credible sources. The statement "FBI Runs The Background Checks Gave The Terrorist The OK For Weapons FBI Didn't Investigate" is a fabrication and goes against common sense and the known practices of the FBI.  The FBI is a law enforcement agency in the United States that is responsible for investigating a wide range of federal crimes, including terrorism. It is highly unlikely that the FBI would approve a background check for a terrorist, as the agency is dedicated to preventing and investigating terrorism. The statement in the text is a form of misinformation and is not based on any factual evidence.
The text "Students and citizens chanting slogans Chowkidar Chor Hai at India Gate" is a statement of fact, and it does not go against common sense. It describes an event that took place, where a crowd of people gathered at India Gate and chanted the slogan "Chowkidar Chor Hai," which translates to "The Chowkidar is a thief" in English. This slogan was used during political protests in India, and it refers to Narendra Modi, who was the Prime Minister of India at the time. The slogan was a criticism of Modi's administration and was part of a larger political discourse.

The text in the image appears to be in Hindi, and it seems to be discussing a situation where a person is being fact-checked. The text mentions that the person being fact-checked is being asked about their religious beliefs, which is a sensitive topic. It also mentions that the person is being asked about their caste, which is a social category that is often considered private and personal in many cultures.  The text does not provide any information that goes against common sense. It seems to be a straightforward description of a fact-checking scenario. However, the context of the fact-checking and the potential implications for the person being fact-checked are not specified in the text, so it's not possible to determine if there's anything in the text that goes against common sense without additional information.
The text "Doctors with Covid forced to treat patients" is a misleading statement. It is not common sense or accurate to say that doctors who have tested positive for COVID-19 are being forced to treat patients. In fact, medical professionals who have tested positive for COVID-19 are typically required to isolate and not work in healthcare settings to prevent the spread of the virus. This is a standard precaution to protect both the healthcare workers and their patients.
The text in the image appears to be a statement about a person's actions or policies. Without additional context, it's difficult to determine if the statement is accurate or not. However, the statement "Trump Has Been Tough on Russia Except Rhetorically" could be interpreted in different ways depending on one's perspective.  If "tough on Russia" refers to actual actions taken by the individual in question, then the statement could be seen as a critique or an observation. If "tough on Russia" is meant to imply that the person has been tough on Russia in terms of rhetoric, then the statement could be seen as a compliment or an acknowledgment of the person's ability to communicate a strong stance against Russia.  Without more information, it's not possible to definitively say whether the statement is accurate or not. It's also important to note that interpretations of such statements can vary widely based on individual beliefs and biases.
The text "Super blue blood moon July ," is a description of a celestial event that occurred on July 27, 2018. It is a combination of different types of lunar eclipses:  1. "Super" refers to the moon appearing larger than usual due to its proximity to Earth. 2. "Blue" refers to the color of the moon during the eclipse, which is often a deep blue color. 3. "Blood" refers to the reddish color of the moon during the eclipse, which is caused by the scattering of sunlight by the Earth's atmosphere.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a factual description of a natural phenomenon.
The text "Coronavirus could kill more than million people by the end of the year, researchers say" is a statement of a prediction or projection made by researchers. It is not a statement that goes against common sense, as it is based on scientific modeling and analysis of data. However, it is important to note that such predictions are subject to change as new data becomes available and as the course of the pandemic evolves. Additionally, the text does not provide any context or evidence to support the claim, which is a common sense requirement for making assertions about the real world.
The text "30 DEAD, 3,000 WOUNDED" suggests a significant loss of life and injuries, which is a serious and tragic event. The phrase "like a nuclear bomb" is a hyperbolic comparison, implying that the explosion was extremely powerful and destructive. However, without more context or information, it is not possible to determine if the explosion was actually caused by a nuclear weapon or if it was a different type of explosion. The text is likely intended to convey the severity of the event, but it is important to verify such claims with reliable sources.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline, which seems to be reporting on a situation in Kashmir. However, the text is cut off and not fully visible, which makes it difficult to provide a complete and accurate interpretation of the content.  From what is visible, the text mentions "Indian occupation forces" and "over , people in Oppressed Kashmir," which could be interpreted as a statement about a conflict or situation in the region. The use of the term "occupation forces" is subjective and could be seen as biased or inflammatory, depending on one's perspective on the situation in Kashmir.  Without the full context of the news story and the ability to read the entire headline, it is not possible to determine if there is anything in the text that goes against common sense. It is important to approach such statements with an understanding of the complex and often contentious history and politics of the region.
The text "Supreme Court asks Centre to look into plea to change name of India to Bharat" is a factual statement based on the image provided. It does not go against common sense. The image shows a person sitting at a desk with a gavel, which is commonly used in courtrooms, and a piece of paper, which could be a document related to the case. The text is consistent with the visual content of the image, which suggests that the Supreme Court is involved in a legal process related to a petition to change the name of India.
The text you provided states that the image is the "First photograph of earth, sent by Chandrayan." This statement is not accurate according to common sense and scientific knowledge.  The Chandrayaan mission, launched by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), is a lunar mission that sent a spacecraft to the Moon. The primary objective of the mission was to study the Moon's surface and composition, as well as to search for water ice. The spacecraft, named Chandrayaan-1, was equipped with several scientific instruments, including a high-resolution camera.  However, the camera on Chandrayaan-1 was not designed to take photographs of the Earth from the Moon's orbit. The primary focus of the camera was to study the lunar surface, and it was not capable of taking high-resolution images of Earth from such a distance.  Therefore, the statement that the image is the "First photograph of earth, sent by Chandrayan" is incorrect. The image you've provided is not from the Chandrayaan mission and does not depict the Earth as seen from the Moon.
The text "Tens of thousands of Hong Kong students boycott first day of school" is consistent with the image, which shows a large crowd of people, many of whom appear to be students, gathered in a public space. The presence of numerous individuals in a crowd suggests that there is a significant number of people participating in the event, which aligns with the description of "tens of thousands" of students.  The image and the text together convey a message of a large-scale protest or boycott, which is a common form of collective action to express dissent or to advocate for change. The fact that the event is taking place on the first day of school indicates that the students are making a deliberate choice to participate in the protest rather than attend school.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The statement accurately reflects the situation depicted in the image.
The text in the image reads: "Coronavirus One suspected victim quarantined at WeijaGbawe Hospital."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It appears to be a factual statement about a single individual who is suspected of having contracted the coronavirus and is being quarantined at a hospital for observation and treatment. The statement is clear and does not contain any information that would be considered unusual or counterintuitive.
The text you provided states that Indian police officers were filmed joining Hindutva rioters in throwing rocks at Muslim-owned shops and houses in Delhi. This statement is consistent with the images and news reports that have been widely circulated, which show police officers participating in violent actions alongside rioters.  The statement is not against common sense, as it accurately reflects the events that have been documented and reported by various media outlets. The images and news reports show a situation where law enforcement officers are not acting in accordance with their duty to protect citizens and maintain law and order. This is a serious matter that raises concerns about the role of the police in such situations and the potential for bias or complicity in the violence.
The text provided does not contain any information about Cyclone Amphan. It is a statement about the impending impact of Cyclone Amphan on India and Bangladesh. The text does not go against common sense, as it is a factual statement about a natural disaster.
The text provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It describes a bicycle rally in Bhopal on the occasion of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's birthday, with a group of people riding bicycles and holding posters. The text also mentions that the rally is being held in front of a Sony store, which is an unusual location for a political rally but does not contradict common sense. The event is likely organized to celebrate Rahul Gandhi's birthday and to promote cycling as a mode of transportation.
The text you've provided appears to be discussing the relationship between the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and the subsequent occurrence of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. It suggests that the vaccine rollout might be coinciding with an increase in these metrics, which could lead to confusion about whether the vaccine is causing the increase or if it's merely a coincidence.  The text does not contain anything that directly goes against common sense. It raises a valid point about the timing of the vaccine rollout and the subsequent increase in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, which is a topic of ongoing discussion and research.  However, it's important to note that the text does not provide any evidence or data to support the claim that the vaccine rollout is causing the increase in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. This is a complex issue that requires careful analysis of data and scientific studies to draw accurate conclusions.  In general, vaccines are designed to prevent diseases, not cause them. The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has been associated with a decrease in severe cases and deaths, as well as a reduction in the overall burden on healthcare systems. This is supported by a large body of scientific evidence and real-world data.
The image you've provided appears to be a chart of citrus fruits, categorized by their type and set of six. The text "FRUIT" is prominently displayed at the top, and there are labels for each type of citrus fruit.  The news text at the bottom seems to be a personal statement or a headline, but it does not provide any information that goes against common sense. It simply mentions that the person who wrote it eats a lot of citrus fruits and drinks alkaline water.  Without additional context, it's difficult to determine if the news text is related to the citrus fruit chart or if it's an unrelated statement. However, the information provided in the news text is consistent with common knowledge about healthy eating habits and the potential benefits of alkaline water.
The text in the image appears to be a call to action for COVID-19 vaccination, encouraging people to get their walk-in vaccines. It mentions that first and second doses are available for those eligible, and that personal health numbers or appointments are not needed. It also states that anyone 12+ currently living in Fraser Health can find a location for the vaccine on the Fraser Health website.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is providing accurate information about the availability of COVID-19 vaccines and how to access them. The text is clear and informative, and it does not contain any misleading or contradictory statements.
The text in the image is in Hindi and translates to: "After the polls, the people of West Bengal are being killed. The government is silent. The media is silent. The people are being killed. The government is silent. The media is silent."  The statement "Since postpoll violence erupted in West Bengal, old and unrelated visuals have been shared on social media." is a factual observation. It is not a statement that goes against common sense. It is a commentary on the situation in West Bengal and the use of unrelated images to depict the situation.  The images in the collage appear to show a vehicle being attacked, which is consistent with the description of post-poll violence. However, without additional context, it is not possible to determine the authenticity or relevance of these images to the situation in West Bengal.
The text "More than lakh people emerge at the Joint Rally of Congress and CPIM at Brigade Ground in the Heart of Kolkata!" suggests that there is a large gathering of people at a political rally. The term "lakh" refers to 100,000, so the text is stating that there are more than 100,000 people at the rally.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward statement about the size of the crowd at a political event.
The text in the image appears to be a quote attributed to Naseeruddin Shah, an actor, regarding the farmers' protest in India. The quote seems to be a statement of opinion or observation about the situation, and it does not contain anything that goes against common sense. It is a statement about the film industry's response to the protest, suggesting that the industry is not as supportive or vocal as it could be. The text is clear and does not contain any contradictory or nonsensical statements.
The text in the image states, "More than three times as many black women die from childbirth, and the gap is widening." This statement is based on data from the CDC Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System and is credited to Sarah Frostenson. The chart shows that in 2011, 42.8% of black women died from childbirth compared to 12.5% of white women.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The statement is a factual representation of data from a reputable source, the CDC. It highlights a significant disparity in maternal mortality rates between black and white women in the United States. This disparity is a well-documented issue in public health and is a matter of concern for many due to its implications for health equity and social justice.
The text you provided is a statement about the conspiracy theory surrounding the documentary "Plandemic." The statement is not factual and goes against common sense, as it suggests that a group of billionaires intentionally caused the coronavirus pandemic for their own gain. This is a baseless and unsubstantiated claim that has been widely debunked by credible sources. The coronavirus pandemic is a global health crisis that has affected millions of people and has been traced back to its origins in Wuhan, China, not the result of a conspiracy by billionaires.
The text in the image is a headline that reads, "Remember Ken Starr? His Plane Just Disappeared On His Way To DC To Testify." The headline is followed by a subheadline that says, "Bacon Wrapped Scallops, Dirty Moore Beef Stew."  The headline itself is a piece of fake news. It is not credible because it is making a false claim about a public figure, Ken Starr, who is known to be alive and well. The subheadline, however, seems to be a genuine article about food, which is unrelated to the fake news headline.  The image also includes a picture of a smoke plume, which is not related to the fake news headline. The smoke plume could be from a fire or an explosion, but without additional context, it's not possible to determine the cause of the smoke.  In summary, the headline is a piece of fake news, and the image includes an unrelated picture of a smoke plume.
The text in the image appears to be a statement made by Mike Pence, the former Vice President of the United States. The statement is about the Clinton Foundation and the percentage of its funds that go to charitable causes.  The statement "Last night, Pence said, cents on the dollar from the Clinton Foundation goes to charitable causes." is not inherently against common sense. It seems to be a factual statement about the Clinton Foundation's charitable giving.  However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine the accuracy of the statement. It's important to note that the Clinton Foundation has been the subject of controversy and investigations, and the percentage of funds that go to charitable causes has been a topic of debate.  It's also worth noting that the image includes a graphic of a lie detector test, which suggests that the statement is being questioned or challenged. This could imply that the statement is being scrutinized or that there is some doubt about its accuracy.
The text "PM says Our soldiers' sacrifices won't go to waste after Ladakh faceoff" is a statement attributed to the Prime Minister of India. It is a common sense statement that expresses a commitment to honoring the sacrifices made by soldiers in the context of a military confrontation. The statement is not inherently against common sense, as it reflects a moral and ethical stance that is generally expected from a leader in times of conflict.
The text in the image appears to be a headline from a news source. It states, "via Moore Accuser Says She Wrote Part of Yearbook Inscription." This headline suggests that the accuser of a public figure is claiming that she wrote part of the yearbook inscription for that figure.  The headline itself does not go against common sense. It is a straightforward statement of a claim made by an individual. However, the content of the headline, if it is accurate, could be considered newsworthy and potentially significant, depending on the context of the situation it is referring to.  It is important to note that the headline is a summary of a story, and the full context of the story, including the evidence and the credibility of the accuser, would be necessary to fully understand the implications of the claim.
The text in the image is a quote from Jeremy Hunt, who is identified as the UK Foreign Secretary. The quote states: "The people of Venezuela have suffered enough.

It is a statement of policy or position by the UK Foreign Secretary, expressing a desire for democratic processes in Venezuela. The statement is consistent with the principles of democracy and the importance of free and fair elections.
The text in the image appears to be discussing the differences between the COVID-19 pandemic and the Spanish flu pandemic. It mentions that while both pandemics have caused significant global disruptions, the Spanish flu was characterized by a much higher mortality rate and a shorter duration. The text also notes that the Spanish flu was more severe in terms of symptoms and had a greater impact on the global economy.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The text is providing factual information about the differences between the two pandemics, which is consistent with what we know about the historical context and the severity of each pandemic.
The image you've provided appears to be a chart comparing the number of COVID-19 tests conducted per million people in various countries as of March 2020. The chart is sourced from Vox and includes data from the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Netherlands, Israel, Taiwan, Italy, South Korea, China, and Guangdong, China.  From the data presented, it is clear that South Korea and China conducted significantly more tests per million people than the United States. This is a factual observation that is consistent with the data presented in the chart.  The text "SHAMEFUL America has done tests per million people Korea tests per million people US is x behind!" is a subjective statement that is not based on the data presented in the chart. It is an editorial commentary that is meant to convey a message of criticism or concern about the United States' testing efforts compared to other countries.  The statement "Test counts do not include full reporting from all US labs" is a factual note that acknowledges a limitation in the data being presented. It suggests that the actual number of tests conducted in the United States may be higher than the numbers shown in the chart due to incomplete reporting.  Overall, the chart and accompanying text provide a factual representation of testing efforts in various countries, with a subjective commentary on the United States' performance.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a caption that describes a situation in Hong Kong. It mentions a shooting incident involving a protester and a man being set on fire, which are indeed serious and violent events.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward description of a news event. However, it is important to note that the image itself is a still from a video, and without additional context, it is not possible to verify the accuracy of the news report. It is always advisable to cross-check news sources and seek out reliable information when interpreting news events.
The text in the image appears to be a tweet from a verified account, which is likely to be a public figure or a news organization. The text reads:  "Very sad to hear about the death of Maradona. A great person. Her music was wonderful. I remember listening to her albums in the early 1980's. Rest In Peace!"  There are a few issues with the text:  1. The name "Maradona" is associated with Diego Maradona, a famous soccer player who passed away in 2020. However, the text refers to "her," which suggests that the person being referred to is female. This creates a contradiction and is likely a mistake.  2. The text refers to "her music," which is an unusual way to describe a soccer player. It is possible that the person who wrote the tweet meant to say "his music," but the use of "her" is incorrect.  3. The text mentions "listening to her albums in the early 1980's," which is an anachronism. Diego Maradona was born in 1960, and his career as a soccer player spanned from the 1970s to the 1990s. It is unlikely that he released any albums in the 1980s.  4. The text ends
The image shows a schedule for a number coding scheme in Cebu City, which is a traffic regulation implemented to reduce traffic congestion. The schedule indicates that vehicles with license plates ending in specific numbers will be allowed to travel on specific days of the week.

It is a reasonable approach to managing traffic flow in a busy urban area.  The list of exempted vehicles is also provided, which includes vehicles that are not subject to the number coding scheme. This list is typical for such regulations, as it ensures that certain types of vehicles, such as emergency vehicles, are not restricted by the number coding scheme.  The image also includes a source credit to the Cebu City Government, which is standard practice for news articles to provide the source of the information.  Overall, the text and schedule presented in the image are consistent with common sense and are part of a traffic management strategy.
The text in the image suggests that meditation can help boost the immune system and prevent the spread of coronavirus. While meditation can have various health benefits, including stress reduction and improved mental well-being, there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that it can specifically prevent or treat the coronavirus.  It is important to note that the prevention and treatment of the coronavirus involve following public health guidelines, such as hand hygiene, social distancing, and wearing masks, as well as getting vaccinated when eligible. While meditation can be a beneficial part of a holistic approach to health, it should not be relied upon as a sole method to prevent or treat the coronavirus.
The text in the image appears to be a press release from the United States Capitol Police. It announces the passing of a police officer named Brian Sicknick. The text is straightforward and does not contain any information that goes against common sense.

The image you've provided appears to be a chart from the COVID-19 Tracking Project, which is a collaboration of researchers from Harvard and Brown Universities. The chart shows the number of daily COVID-19 tests, daily cases, and daily deaths in the United States over a period of time from March 1 to October 21.  The chart does not provide any information that directly contradicts common sense. It shows the trends of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths over time, which is a useful way to understand the impact of the pandemic.  However, it's important to note that the chart does not provide context for the data, such as the number of tests conducted, the population size of the areas being tracked, or the specific time period for each data point. Without this context, it's difficult to make direct comparisons between different data points.  Additionally, the chart does not provide information on the effectiveness of public health measures, such as vaccinations or mask mandates, which could be important for understanding the impact of these measures on the pandemic.  Lastly, the chart does not provide any information on the accuracy of the data, which is crucial for understanding the reliability of the numbers presented.  In summary, the chart itself does not contain anything that directly contradicts common sense, but it's important to consider the context and limitations of the data presented.
The text in the image discusses the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential for a universal basic income (UBI) to address the challenges posed by the crisis. It mentions that economists Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee argue that the pandemic has highlighted the need for a UBI, as it could provide a safety net for those who have lost their livelihoods.  The text does not contain anything that goes against common sense. It presents a well-reasoned argument for the implementation of a UBI in the context of the pandemic, which is a topic of ongoing debate and discussion among economists and policymakers. The text is based on the premise that the pandemic has caused widespread economic hardship, and that a UBI could help to alleviate some of the negative effects of this crisis.
The text in the image states, "President Trump Unemployment has recently achieved the lowest rate in years." This statement is not inherently against common sense, as it is a factual observation about the unemployment rate during the Trump presidency. The unemployment rate did reach its lowest point in nearly 50 years during the Trump administration. However, it is important to note that the unemployment rate can be influenced by various factors, including economic conditions, government policies, and demographic changes. Therefore, while the statement is factual, it does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the underlying economic conditions or the reasons for the low unemployment rate.
The text in the image appears to be a message related to Muharram ul Haram, which is a significant month in the Islamic calendar. The message seems to be a call for sharing and praying for Kashmir, which is a region that has been the subject of conflict and political unrest for many years.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward message that seems to be promoting a message of solidarity and support for a region that has faced significant challenges. The message is consistent with the principles of compassion and unity that are often emphasized during the holy month of Muharram.
The text in the image appears to be a headline from the Associated Press (AP) news agency. The headline reads: "Hoax report claims China sought Supreme Court approval to euthanise, coronavirus patients."  The statement "Hoax report claims" suggests that the information is not verified and is being reported as a rumor or unsubstantiated claim. The term "hoax report" implies that the information is not credible and is likely false.  The headline is likely referring to a report that was circulating on social media or the internet, which made the claim that China sought Supreme Court approval to euthanize COVID-19 patients. However, without further context or evidence, it is not possible to determine the veracity of the claim.  It is important to be cautious when sharing or reporting on unverified information, as it can contribute to the spread of misinformation and panic.
The text in the image states, "More than three times as many black women die from childbirth, and the gap is widening." This statement is based on data from the CDC Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System and is credited to Sarah Frostenson. The chart shows that in 2011, 42.8% of black women died from childbirth compared to 12.5% of white women.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The statement is a factual representation of data from a reputable source, the CDC. It highlights a significant disparity in maternal mortality rates between black and white women in the United States. This disparity is a well-documented issue in public health and is a matter of concern for many due to its implications for health equity and social justice.
The text in the image appears to be discussing the use of face masks in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It mentions that while many countries have implemented the use of face masks, there is scientific evidence supporting their efficacy in reducing the transmission of coronavirus. The text also notes that there are health effects associated with wearing face masks, such as lack of oxygen, adverse physiological effects, and psychological effects.  The statement "Although, scientific evidence supporting facemasks efficacy is lacking, adverse physiological, psychological amp" seems to be a contradiction. It suggests that while there is a lack of scientific evidence for the efficacy of face masks, there are adverse physiological and psychological effects associated with their use. This statement goes against common sense because it implies that face masks are ineffective in preventing the spread of a highly contagious virus, yet they are causing significant health problems.  However, it's important to note that the text is incomplete and the context of the rest of the article is not provided. The statement could be part of a larger discussion or analysis that might clarify the intended message. It's also worth noting that the scientific consensus on the effectiveness of face masks in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 is well-established, and the adverse effects are generally mild and temporary.
The text in the image appears to be a headline or a statement that is meant to be sensational or attention-grabbing. It suggests that Dallas Jones, who is identified as a campaign staffer for the Biden campaign, was arrested for voter fraud.  However, the text is not consistent with common sense or with the information that is typically reported in credible news sources. Voter fraud is a serious issue, and it is not common for campaign staffers to be arrested for it. Additionally, the text does not provide any evidence or context to support the claim that Dallas Jones was arrested for voter fraud.  Therefore, based on the information provided in the image, it is not accurate to say that Dallas Jones was arrested for voter fraud. The text seems to be a misleading or false statement, which could be intended to mislead or to generate clicks or shares on social media.
The image shows a person receiving a COVID-19 vaccination, and the text "COVID vaccines are working in the real world" is consistent with the common sense understanding that vaccines are effective in preventing the spread of the virus in the real world. This is supported by scientific evidence and public health data.
The image shows a building with a flag that resembles the flag of Pakistan, but it is not the actual flag of Pakistan. The flag on the building has a white crescent and star on a blue background, which is the flag of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. However, the flag on the building is not the official flag of Pakistan, which is the national flag of the country.  The text in the image suggests that the flag on the building is a "Pakistan flag," but it is not the official flag of Pakistan. The flag on the building is likely a symbol of cultural or religious significance, rather than a representation of the national flag.  The text also mentions that the building is a "Kartarpursahib Gurudwara," which is a Sikh temple located in Pakistan. The presence of a flag that resembles the flag of Pakistan on a Sikh temple could be seen as a symbol of cultural or religious harmony, or it could be seen as a political statement.  Overall, the image and text do not go against common sense. They accurately describe the scene and the context in which it was taken.
The text you provided does not seem to go against common sense. It describes a situation where there is a protest march against a hostel fee hike, and the police are present, which is a common occurrence during such events. The text does not provide any information that would be considered unusual or counterintuitive. It appears to be a straightforward description of a protest event.
The image you've provided appears to be a screenshot from a video or a still image from a presentation, showing a close-up of a Martian surface with a series of images at the bottom that seem to be of a rover landing on Mars. The text "Perseverance arrives at Mars!" is a statement that is consistent with common sense, as it accurately reflects the event that took place on February 18, 2021, when the Perseverance rover successfully landed on Mars.  The image of the Martian surface shows a rocky terrain with a wavy pattern, which is typical of the Martian landscape. The series of images at the bottom likely represent the different stages of the rover's descent and landing, which is a common practice in space exploration to document the process.  There is nothing in the text or the image that goes against common sense. The statement is factual, and the images are consistent with what one would expect to see during a Mars landing.
The text provided is a statement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regarding what to do if someone is sick with COVID-19 or suspects they might have it. The statement is consistent with common sense and public health guidelines. It advises individuals to stay home, avoid close contact with others, and wear a mask when around others. It also recommends seeking medical care if symptoms are severe, and to follow the instructions of healthcare providers.  The image shows a person with a hand to their face, which could be interpreted as a gesture of discomfort or illness. However, without additional context, it's not possible to determine if the person in the image is actually sick with COVID-19 or if they are simply displaying a common gesture. The image does not provide any information that goes against common sense or public health guidelines.
The text provided appears to be a news headline or summary, and it does not contain anything that goes against common sense. It describes a situation where a person named Daunte Wright is alleged to have committed a crime, which is consistent with the information typically found in news articles. The text is factual and does not contain any logical contradictions or absurd statements.
The text in the image states, "Donald Trump is wrong that Americans don't care about his tax returns." This statement is not inherently against common sense, as it is a factual assertion about public opinion regarding the release of President Trump's tax returns. However, the statement could be considered controversial or subject to interpretation, depending on one's perspective on the issue.
The text in the image appears to be a screenshot of a social media post with a caption that reads "15 year old girl raped still in hospital by , Nisar, Salman, Zakir amp." The text is in Hindi, and it seems to be reporting an incident of rape.  There are several elements in the text that might be considered unusual or against common sense:  1. The text mentions a minor girl being raped, which is a serious and sensitive issue. It's important to handle such information with care and to ensure that the details are accurate and not sensationalized.  2. The text lists several names, which could be interpreted as an accusation against these individuals. It's crucial to verify the accuracy of such accusations before making them public, as they can have serious consequences for the individuals named.  3. The text includes a hashtag (#SMHoax) which might suggest that the post is intended to be humorous or satirical. However, the subject matter is not appropriate for humor, and the use of such a hashtag could be seen as insensitive or in poor taste.  4. The text includes a picture of a person who appears to be in distress or pain. It's important to be sensitive to the emotional state of individuals in such situations and to avoid using images that could be distressing to viewers.  5
The text in the image appears to be a headline from an article discussing a report by UNICEF that suggests pornography is not always harmful to children. This statement goes against common sense and is likely to be controversial, as many people believe that exposure to pornography can have negative effects on children, including the normalization of sexual behavior, the development of unhealthy attitudes towards sex, and the potential for exploitation.  The headline is likely to be misleading or inaccurate, as it implies that UNICEF, an organization known for its work in protecting children's rights and well-being, is endorsing the idea that pornography is not harmful to children. However, without reading the full article, it's not possible to determine the context or the accuracy of the headline. It's important to approach such headlines with caution and to seek out reliable sources for information on sensitive topics.
The text provided in the image appears to be a statement made by the Press Secretary of the White House. It seems to be a standard statement regarding the imposition of new Russian sanctions by the United States. The statement does not contain anything that goes against common sense. It is a clear and concise explanation of the administration's position on the matter.
The text in the image states, "No Coronavirus Test Kits Made in India, Shortage Caused by Imports Stuck in Airlines Lockdown, Says Thyrocare."  The statement "No Coronavirus Test Kits Made in India" is not accurate according to the information available as of March 17, 2020. India is indeed a major manufacturer of COVID-19 test kits, and several Indian companies are producing test kits for both domestic and international use.  The rest of the text seems to be reporting on a specific issue related to the import of test kits and the challenges faced by the company mentioned, Thyrocare, in getting those kits delivered.  The statement "India imports all Coronavirus test kits" is also not accurate. While India has been importing some test kits, it is also producing its own test kits.  The text does not provide any information that goes against common sense. It appears to be a factual report on a specific issue related to the import of COVID-19 test kits.
The text in the image appears to be a screenshot of a social media post by a user named "Doc Graham." The post discusses the risks of carbon dioxide toxicity in relation to wearing face masks, particularly in the context of public transportation. The text suggests that wearing face masks can lead to a buildup of carbon dioxide, which can be harmful.  The statement "Face masks to be made mandatory on public transport but read what a surgeon says about the risks of carbon dioxide toxicity" implies that the post is challenging the idea of mandatory face mask use by highlighting potential health risks.  However, it's important to note that the post is not from a reputable medical source and should not be taken as medical advice. The information provided in the post is not supported by scientific consensus or peer-reviewed studies.  The text in the post is not consistent with common sense or scientific understanding of the risks associated with wearing face masks. The scientific consensus is that wearing face masks, particularly in public spaces, is a crucial measure to prevent the spread of airborne diseases, such as COVID-19. There is no evidence to suggest that wearing face masks increases the risk of carbon dioxide toxicity.  In conclusion, the text in the image is not consistent with common sense or scientific understanding and should not be relied upon as a source of accurate information about the risks of wearing face masks.
The text in the image is in Finnish and it reads: "Predikarin 3:5 ad kasta steinum hefur sinn tima, ad fadmast hefur sinn tima og ad haldá ser fra fadmlogum hefur sinn tima."  Translated into English, it says: "Predictor 3:5 says that the steinum hefur sinne tima, ad fadmast hefur sinne tima og ad haldá ser fra fadmlogum hefur sinne tima."  This text appears to be a quote from the Bible, specifically from the book of Predictor (which is not a book in the Bible, but rather a title given to the third book of the Minor Prophets in the Hebrew Bible). The text is discussing the consequences of eating certain foods, specifically those containing steinum hefur sinne tima, which is a type of poison.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense, as it is a religious or spiritual text discussing dietary restrictions and the potential consequences of consuming certain substances. It is important to note that the Bible is a religious text and its teachings are based on faith and spiritual beliefs, not on scientific or empirical evidence.
The text "It's Gold for us at the Cadet World Wrestling Championship today!" is a statement of achievement and celebration. It is a common sense statement that conveys the wrestlers' success in winning a gold medal at the Cadet World Wrestling Championship. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense.
The text in the image appears to be a statement about the perspectives of Kashmiris and Indians towards each other. It suggests that many Kashmiris view India as an occupying power, and conversely, many Indians view Kashmiris as the enemy. This statement reflects a complex and longstanding conflict between India and Pakistan over the region of Kashmir.  The statement itself does not go against common sense, as it accurately reflects the perspectives of many individuals within these communities. However, it is important to note that the situation in Kashmir is multifaceted and has a long history, with many factors contributing to the conflict. The statement does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the situation, and it is always advisable to seek out diverse perspectives and information when discussing sensitive and complex issues.
The text provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It accurately describes the situation in Beirut, Lebanon, where a large explosion occurred in the port area, causing significant damage and shock to the city. The text is consistent with what one would expect to hear about such an event.
The text in the image appears to be a caption or description related to the image of Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone at an event. It mentions "DeepVeer," which is a playful nickname for the couple, and "MY," which could refer to a specific moment or memory. The rest of the text is not fully visible, but it seems to be a casual, informal statement rather than a formal or factual one.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It seems to be a personal or fan-related comment rather than a statement of fact. The text is not providing any information that would be considered unusual or contrary to common sense.
The text in the image states, "Sanctuary cities must cooperate with immigration authorities." This statement is not inherently against common sense, as it is a policy position that has been debated in various jurisdictions. Some people argue that sanctuary cities should not cooperate with immigration authorities, while others believe that they should. The statement is a reflection of a political or legal stance, and whether it goes against common sense would depend on one's perspective on the issue of sanctuary cities and immigration policy.
The image you've provided shows two different scenes of wildfires. The text accompanying the image states, "Trump is wrong about what is causing the devastating fires in California." This statement is not factual and goes against common sense. It is not appropriate to make political statements or accusations without providing evidence or context to support them. The cause of wildfires in California is a complex issue that involves a combination of factors, including climate change, drought, and human activity. It is not accurate to attribute the cause of these fires to a single individual or entity without considering the broader context and scientific understanding of the issue.
The text provided in the image seems to be a description of a protest or demonstration involving women farmers. It mentions that the women are carrying flags and shouting slogans, which is consistent with the actions of protesters. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The text appears to be a straightforward description of an event.
The image shows a truck with a sign that reads "Reliance Foundation Oxygen," which is a clarification by Reliance Foundation that they are providing oxygen and not oxygen-filled tanks. The text in the image does not provide any information that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward statement about the purpose of the truck.
The text in the image reads: "BREAKING NEWS"  The statement "Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman says five Russians who were not military personnel may have been killed in clash with U." is not inherently against common sense. It is a statement that appears to be reporting on a news event.  However, without additional context, it is not possible to determine the accuracy or credibility of the statement. It is important to verify news reports with reliable sources before accepting them as fact.
The text provided does not seem to go against common sense. It appears to be a statement from a news source or a reporter, discussing a legal matter involving a public figure and their assistant. The statement is consistent with what one might expect to hear in a news report about a legal issue involving a public figure.
The text in the image appears to be a summary of the events surrounding the explosion in Beirut, Lebanon, on August 4, 2020. It mentions that the explosion was equivalent to a kiloton blast site, which is a measure of the energy released by the explosion. This is a common way to describe the size of an explosion, with a kiloton being equivalent to the energy released by one thousand tons of TNT.  The comparison to the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima is a way to convey the scale of the explosion, but it's important to note that the energy released by the Beirut explosion is not the same as the energy released by an atomic bomb. An atomic bomb releases energy through nuclear reactions, whereas the explosion in Beirut was likely caused by a chemical reaction, possibly involving ammonium nitrate.  The text does not contain anything that goes against common sense. It accurately describes the events and the scale of the explosion, which is a significant event that has been widely reported and analyzed.
The text provided in the image is consistent with the historical event it depicts. It states that the photo shows moments after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, which is a well-documented event in history. The text does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It accurately describes the image as showing a crowd of people, including some who appear to be in distress, which is consistent with the aftermath of a violent event like a political assassination.
The text in the image appears to be a warning about the dangers of consuming Corona beer, suggesting that it can cause the coronavirus. However, this is a false claim. Corona beer is not associated with the coronavirus, and there is no scientific evidence to support the idea that drinking Corona beer can cause the virus. The image is likely intended to be humorous or satirical, but it is important to note that the coronavirus is a serious public health concern and should not be trivialized or associated with any product in a misleading way.
The text in the image states: "New report from MMWR on COVIDID-19-related deaths in NYC: Between March and May, a total of , people died in New York City."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a factual statement based on the data provided by the MMWR (Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report), which is a publication of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The text is reporting on the number of COVID-19-related deaths in New York City during a specific time period.
The text provided in the image does not go against common sense. It states that the explosion in Beirut was caused by an estimated 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate left unsecured in a warehouse. This is a plausible explanation for the explosion, as ammonium nitrate is a highly explosive substance when improperly stored or mishandled. The presence of such a large quantity of ammonium nitrate in a warehouse without proper security measures in place is indeed a cause for concern and could potentially lead to a catastrophic explosion.
The text "Blankenship slams Cocaine Mitch in antiMcConnell ad" is a headline that seems to be a sensationalized or exaggerated statement. It suggests that a person named Blankenship is making an accusation against Mitch McConnell, but without more context, it's difficult to determine the accuracy or credibility of the claim.  The term "Cocaine Mitch" is a derogatory nickname that has been used in political discourse, but it's important to note that such nicknames are often used in a hyperbolic or satirical manner and may not reflect reality.  The headline itself is a form of clickbait, designed to grab attention and provoke a reaction. It's possible that the actual content of the ad or the context of Blankenship's statement is more nuanced or less sensational than the headline suggests.  In general, it's important to approach such headlines with a critical eye and to seek out reliable sources of information for a more accurate understanding of the situation.
The text in the image is a statement made by former US President Donald Trump. The statement is about the impeachment proceedings against him, where he accused the Democrat-controlled House of not asking former National Security Adviser John Bolton to testify.  Whether or not this statement goes against common sense depends on one's perspective and understanding of the events leading up to the impeachment proceedings. However, it is generally accepted that the impeachment process in the United States is a formal and serious matter, and that the House of Representatives has the authority to call witnesses and request testimony as part of their investigation.  In this case, the House did in fact request John Bolton to testify, but he declined to appear. The House then issued a subpoena for his testimony, which was later blocked by the White House. The House ultimately voted to approve articles of impeachment against Trump, which included allegations related to his dealings with Ukraine.  Therefore, according to the information available at the time of the impeachment proceedings, it is not accurate to say that the House never asked John Bolton to testify. However, it is worth noting that the impeachment process is complex and can involve many moving parts, and that the specific circumstances surrounding the request for Bolton's testimony may have been subject to interpretation and debate.
The text "Trump EPA chief slams government climate report" suggests that the EPA chief under the Trump administration is criticizing a report on climate change produced by the government. The statement implies that the EPA chief disagrees with the findings or conclusions of the report.  Whether or not the EPA chief's stance on the report goes against common sense would depend on the specific content of the report and the EPA chief's reasons for disagreeing with it. If the report presents scientific evidence that human activities are causing climate change and the EPA chief denies this, then this would go against common sense, as the overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that human activities are the primary cause of climate change.  However, without more context or information about the report and the EPA chief's specific criticisms, it's not possible to definitively say whether the EPA chief's stance goes against common sense.
The text in the image states: "COVID-19 UPDATE: WHO had declared that COVID is now on pandemic stage."  This statement is not accurate according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO has indeed declared COVID-19 a pandemic, but it did so on March 11, 2020, not on March 19, as stated in the image. The image appears to be a screenshot from a news source, and the date in the image is incorrect.  The text in the image is not consistent with the timeline of the WHO's declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic. Therefore, the text goes against common sense and the accurate reporting of events.
The image you've provided appears to be a sculpture or a piece of art that is designed to look like a tree with human figures integrated into it. The text you've provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It seems to be a straightforward description of the image. If there is something specific you're referring to that you believe goes against common sense, please provide more context or clarify what you're asking.
The image shows a person sitting amidst a large quantity of vegetables, which appears to be a market or a storage area for produce. The text "Mrs." is not part of the image and does not provide any context or information that would go against common sense.  Common sense would suggest that the person is likely a vendor or a worker in the vegetable market or storage area, given the large amount of produce around them. The presence of a variety of vegetables indicates that this is a place where fresh produce is sold or stored.  Without additional context, it's difficult to determine if there's anything in the text that goes against common sense, as the text is not visible in the image provided. If you have a specific question or concern about the text, please provide more details or clarify your question.
The image shows a person sitting among a large quantity of vegetables, including what appears to be a significant amount of cucumbers. The text in the image is not clear enough to read, so I cannot provide any information about the content of the text.  Regarding the common sense aspect, it's important to note that the image is a photograph and may not represent a typical or common scenario. It could be a staged photo, a moment captured during a harvest, or a scene from a market or farm. Without additional context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of the situation.  If the text in the image is related to the scene, it might provide more information about the context or the person's role in the situation. However, without clear text, it's not possible to make any definitive statements about the content of the text or whether it goes against common sense.
The image you've provided appears to be a microscopic view of a virus, possibly a coronavirus, given the spiky surface that is characteristic of many viruses. The text "How to conquer Top treatments in development" is not visible in the image, so I'm unable to provide a response based on the text.  However, I can comment on the image itself. It's important to note that the image is a microscopic representation of a virus, which is not something that can be directly interacted with or conquered by humans. Viruses are not living organisms and do not have the ability to be conquered in the same way that a person might conquer a physical challenge or opponent.  The text you've mentioned seems to be a headline or title related to treatments for viruses, which could be related to the image. If you're asking about the content of the text and whether it goes against common sense, I would need to see the text to provide a response.
The image you've provided appears to be a bar chart comparing the average number of deaths per day from various diseases, including tuberculosis (TB), COVID-19, HIV/AIDS, and malaria. The chart is titled "The Leading Infectious Killers Globally" and includes a note at the bottom stating that the data is from July 19th, 2020, and that the values are estimates.  The chart shows that tuberculosis has the highest number of deaths per day, with approximately 4,027 deaths, followed by COVID-19 with 3,020 deaths, HIV/AIDS with 2,109 deaths, and malaria with 1,110 deaths.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The chart is a visual representation of data, and the numbers are based on the most recent data available at the time the chart was created. The chart is a factual representation of the global health burden from these infectious diseases.
The text in the image appears to be a promotional or celebratory message, likely related to the 70th anniversary of the "Peaceful Liberation of Tibet." The text states, "To Better years after the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, the region in southwest China has witnessed the leapfrog development."  The phrase "To Better years" suggests a positive outlook for the future, and the statement about development is a common theme in discussions about the region's economic growth. However, the text does not provide any specific details or evidence to support the claim that the region has experienced "leapfrog development" after the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet.  Whether or not the region has experienced significant development since the event in question is a matter of interpretation and can be subject to various perspectives. It's important to note that the text is likely intended to be optimistic and may not reflect the full complexity of the region's history and current situation.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a statement that is meant to be informative. It does not contain anything that goes against common sense. The headline suggests that the owner of a gun store in Florida reported a man to the FBI, which is a common sense action if the owner believes that the person in question may be a threat or involved in illegal activities. The statement is consistent with the idea that if someone has concerns about a potential threat, they should report it to the appropriate authorities.
The text in the image appears to be a label or information sheet for a medication, which includes a warning that the medication should not be used alone to treat COVID-19. This statement is consistent with the current understanding of COVID-19 treatment, which typically involves a combination of antiviral medications, supportive care, and sometimes monoclonal antibodies or other treatments depending on the severity of the illness and the patient's individual circumstances.  The statement "Remdesivir alone not enough to treat COVID, study says" is a summary of a scientific study or report, which suggests that remdesivir, a medication used to treat COVID-19, may not be effective when used alone. This is consistent with the label's warning that the medication should not be used alone to treat COVID-19.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense, as it accurately reflects the current understanding of COVID-19 treatment and the limitations of remdesivir as a monotherapy.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a description of an event. It mentions that NASA officials will give an update two days before the Perseverance rover is set to touch down on the surface of Mars. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward announcement of an upcoming event related to space exploration.
The text "JUST IN Trump attacks Obama over Flynn ahead of Sally Yates testimony" is a headline from a news source. It appears to be a factual statement based on the information provided. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward report of an event or statement made by a public figure.
The text in the image does not provide any information that goes against common sense. It describes a moment where Queen Elizabeth II is seen smiling and laughing, which is a natural and expected human behavior. The image captures a candid moment of the Queen enjoying herself, which is a positive and relatable aspect of her public persona.
The text provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It is a statement about a flag being flown at half-staff, which is a common practice to show respect or mourning. The statement is factual and does not contain any contradictory or illogical information.
The text in the image appears to be a humorous or satirical statement, as it suggests that a man is "preempting" a congress by being present in a barn with sheep. This is not a typical scenario for a congress, as congresses are usually held in formal settings like conference halls or government buildings. The text is likely meant to be a joke or a play on words, rather than a literal description of an event.
The text "PM Jawaharlal Nehru Arrives In USA , Inspecting Guard of Honour by American Armed Forces" is consistent with the image provided. The image shows a group of individuals in military uniforms, which suggests they are part of a guard of honor. The presence of a person in a suit, who appears to be a dignitary, inspecting the guard of honor is also consistent with the text.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The text accurately describes the scene depicted in the image.
The text you provided is a news headline, and it does not go against common sense. It is a statement of fact, reporting on a tweet by former US President Donald Trump that called for Germany to increase its defense spending within NATO. The headline accurately reflects the content of the tweet.
The text in the image appears to be a screenshot of a social media post with a caption that suggests a correlation between the number of coronavirus deaths and the number of coffins. The post seems to be making a statement about the severity of the coronavirus pandemic, possibly implying that the number of deaths is higher than what is being reported.  However, the text also contains a statement that goes against common sense: "Italy had 17 deaths yesterday alone total deaths of over 4400 in Italy all alone, they r running out of coffins and space also, cremation takes a bout an hour meaning only 24 bodies a day not, just a drop into an ocean."  This statement is problematic because it is not supported by any credible sources and is likely to be misleading or inaccurate. The number of deaths and the capacity of funeral services are not directly related, and the statement about the number of coffins and cremation capacity is not consistent with what is known about the funeral industry's capacity to handle a large number of deaths.  Furthermore, the post seems to be using emotional appeal to provoke a reaction, which is a common tactic in misinformation campaigns. It is important to verify information from credible sources before sharing it, especially in times of crisis when accurate information is crucial.
The text in the image appears to be a statement about the use of hydroxychloroquine for managing COVID-19 in Nigeria. It mentions that hydroxychloroquine is not approved for managing COVID-19 in Nigeria. This statement is consistent with the current scientific consensus, which is that hydroxychloroquine has not been proven to be effective in treating or preventing COVID-19. Therefore, the statement does not go against common sense.
The text in the image appears to be a statement about the potential impact of a pandemic on the United States. It suggests that a pandemic could infect over 160 million people in the United States, which is a significant portion of the population. The text also mentions that the course of the pandemic could be influenced by the actions of the government and the public, and that the duration of the pandemic could be influenced by the effectiveness of containment measures.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The statement is based on the assumption that a pandemic could occur and that it could have a significant impact on the population. This is a reasonable assumption given the history of pandemics and the potential for the spread of infectious diseases. The text also acknowledges that the severity of the pandemic could be mitigated through appropriate measures, which is a common sense approach to managing public health risks.

The text "New video shows inside Notre Dame Cathedral after devastating fire" is consistent with common sense. It describes a situation where a cathedral has experienced a fire, and the image shows the aftermath of the fire. The text is informative and accurately describes the content of the image.
The text in the image does not provide any information that goes against common sense. It appears to be a statement made by a person, possibly in a speech or interview, but without additional context, it's difficult to determine the accuracy or relevance of the statement.
The text in the image appears to be a quote attributed to Bilawal Singh, which is a fictional character from the movie "Lagaan." The quote reads: "Gharo Jao Rajj ke, kaaam hoga gaaj ke. If you leave the house with a stomach full of food, you will ace your mission."  The text is a humorous take on the character's motivational speech, suggesting that having a full stomach will give one the energy and focus needed to succeed in a mission. However, this statement goes against common sense, as it is generally not recommended to eat a large meal before engaging in physical activity or performing tasks that require concentration and quick reflexes. Eating a heavy meal can slow down digestion and cause discomfort, which could negatively impact performance.  The text is meant to be a joke, playing on the idea that the character's unconventional approach to life and leadership is what makes him unique and memorable.

The text on the sign in the image reads: "Blaming Hamas for firing rockets is like blaming a woman for punching her rapist."  This statement is a form of analogy, comparing two different situations to make a point. The analogy suggests that just as it is not fair to blame a woman for defending herself against a rapist, it is not fair to blame Hamas for firing rockets in response to actions by Israel.  The statement is intended to be a critique of what the protester perceives as a biased or unfair perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is not a statement of fact but rather an expression of opinion.  Whether or not the analogy is accurate or effective in conveying the protester's message is subjective and depends on one's perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the context of the protest.
The text "Feb We Myanmar People protesting in front of Central Bank" is a clear and factual statement. It does not contain anything that goes against common sense.

The text in the image reads: "Protect yourself and others. Please wear a mask or face covering in all common areas."

The message is clear and aligns with common sense practices for maintaining personal and public health during times of heightened concern for infectious diseases.
The text in the image appears to be a headline or a summary of a news story. It states that the World Health Organization (WHO) has taken a "complete U turn" and said that coronavirus patients do not need to be isolated, quarantined, or practice social distancing, and that the virus cannot transmit from one patient to another.  The statement that the virus cannot transmit from one patient to another is not consistent with the current understanding of coronavirus transmission. Coronaviruses, including the one that causes COVID-19, are known to spread from person to person through respiratory droplets, close contact, and sometimes by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the face, mouth, or nose.  Therefore, the statement in the text that the virus cannot transmit from one patient to another goes against common sense and the scientific consensus on how coronaviruses spread. It is important to note that the WHO has not made such a statement, and the information in the image is likely inaccurate or misleading.
The text in the image suggests that the CDC is warning men about the dangers of facial hair in relation to the coronavirus. However, the images provided do not show any scientific evidence or logical reasoning to support this claim.  In reality, there is no scientific evidence to suggest that facial hair increases the risk of contracting or spreading the coronavirus. The CDC's guidance on facial hair is primarily focused on the context of medical procedures, such as surgeries, where facial hair can pose a risk of infection.  The text in the image is likely a misinterpretation or a humorous take on the CDC's guidelines, rather than an accurate representation of their official stance on facial hair and the coronavirus. It is important to rely on credible sources for health-related information and not to spread misinformation.
The text provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It accurately describes the situation depicted in the images, which show Joe Biden walking with a surgical boot on his foot after a fracture.

The text on the sign in the image reads: "Blaming Hamas for firing rockets is like blaming a woman for punching her rapist."  This statement is a form of analogy, comparing two different situations to make a point.

The statement is intended to be a critique of what the protester perceives as a biased or unfair perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is not a statement of fact but rather an expression of opinion.  Whether or not the analogy is accurate or effective in conveying the protester's message is subjective and depends on one's perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the context of the protest.
The text in the image states: "Kamala Harris said a BidenHarris administration would not raise taxes while at the same time saying tax cuts passed by Republicans would be eliminated."  This statement does not go against common sense. It is possible for a politician to say that they will not raise taxes while also stating that they will eliminate certain tax cuts. This is because raising taxes and eliminating tax cuts are two different actions. Raising taxes means increasing the amount of money that individuals or businesses are required to pay to the government, while eliminating tax cuts means reducing the amount of money that individuals or businesses are allowed to keep, which can be achieved by repealing or not extending certain tax breaks.  In the context of the image, it appears that Kamala Harris is saying that the Biden-Harris administration would not increase taxes on individuals or businesses, but they would eliminate certain tax cuts that were enacted by the previous administration. This is a common practice in politics, where politicians often propose to repeal or not extend certain policies that were implemented by their opponents.

The text in the image appears to be a screenshot of a social media post or a news article with a headline that seems to be sensationalizing the situation. The headline suggests that hospitals are being pressured to list COVID-19 as the cause of death even if it's not the primary cause, and that lab tests are not required to confirm a COVID-19 death.  The statement "Hospitals to List COVID as Cause of Death Even if It's Assumed to Have Caused Or Contributed to Death Lab Tests Not Required Can we just get the truth and stop this insane panic" is a commentary on the situation, expressing concern about the accuracy of death certificates and the potential for panic to be fueled by misinformation.  However, the text itself does not provide any evidence to support the claim that hospitals are being pressured to list COVID-19 as the cause of death without proper testing. It is important to note that death certificates are typically based on the best available evidence, and medical professionals are trained to make accurate diagnoses.  The statement about lab tests not being required to confirm a COVID-19 death is also not accurate. In most cases, a positive COVID-19 test result is required to confirm a COVID-19 death. However, in some cases, a death may be attributed to COVID-19 if it is believed to have contributed to the death,

The text is consistent with the visual information provided by the image. It describes the bus as being old, which is a fact that can be observed in the image. The text also mentions that the bus is a military bus, which is consistent with the fact that the bus has a damaged roof, which could be the result of an attack. The text also mentions that the bus was targeted by the Palestinian resistance, which is consistent with the fact that the bus is described as being Israeli and the context suggests that the bus was involved in a conflict situation.  Overall, the text accurately describes the image and provides context that is consistent with the visual information.
The text provided in the image appears to be a list of guidelines for preventing the spread of coronavirus.

There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The guidelines are consistent with public health recommendations to reduce the risk of transmission and protect vulnerable populations.
The text in the image is discussing the importance of both COVID-19 vaccines and effective treatments for the disease. It does not contain any information that goes against common sense.

The text in the image appears to be a statement from the Director of the White House National Trade Council regarding the Trump administration's stance on imposing new steel and aluminum tariffs. The statement suggests that the purpose of these tariffs is to save the aluminum and steel industries for the sake of national and economic security.  From a common-sense perspective, the statement seems to be a straightforward explanation of the administration's policy position. It does not contain any obvious contradictions or statements that go against common sense. However, the effectiveness and wisdom of such tariffs are subjects of ongoing debate and economic analysis, which can be influenced by various factors such as the potential impact on jobs, prices, and trade relationships.
The text in the image attributes a quote to Donald Trump that says, "The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition." This statement is not factual and does not reflect common sense. It is a political statement that is not supported by empirical evidence.  The statement is not factual because it oversimplifies a complex political situation in Germany. The German political landscape is not characterized by a single, unified leadership that is universally opposed to migration. There are various political parties and factions with differing views on migration, and the political situation is not as simplistic as the statement suggests.  The statement is also not supported by empirical evidence. There is no credible evidence to suggest that the German public is turning against their leadership due to migration. In fact, numerous polls and surveys have shown that a majority of the German population supports the country's migration policies.  Therefore, the statement in the image is not based on common sense or factual information. It is a political statement that is likely intended to stir up controversy or to influence public opinion.

However, without additional context or information, it is not possible to determine if this is a real news story or if it is a fabrication. It is important to verify news stories through reliable sources before accepting them as accurate.
The text in the image states: "Top 10 highest insured unemployment rates in the U.S. Insured unemployment rates are the ratio of people on unemployment benefits divided by labor force. The national average is 8.7%."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It provides a factual statement about the unemployment rates in the United States, specifically highlighting the top 10 states with the highest insured unemployment rates. The text also clarifies that these rates are calculated as a percentage of the labor force, which is a standard method for measuring unemployment. The statement about the national average is also accurate, as it provides a benchmark for understanding the relative severity of unemployment in the highlighted states.

The text does not provide any information that goes against common sense. It is a factual statement about the dates associated with Sadhvi Pragya and the demolition of the Babri Masjid. The comment from the user is an observation about the age of the individual at the time of the event, which is a reasonable point of discussion.  However, it's important to note that the image is a screenshot from a social media platform, and the context of the conversation is not fully visible.

The text in the image appears to be a statement from the UK Government regarding the classification of COVID-19 as an infectious disease. It states that the UK Government has reviewed the most up-to-date information and has determined that COVID-19 is not a high consequence infectious disease (HCID). This classification is significant because it affects the level of response and containment measures that are put in place for such diseases.  The statement is likely to be controversial and may go against common sense for several reasons:  1. **Public Perception**: The public might perceive this classification as downplaying the severity of COVID-19, especially given the significant impact it has had on global health and the economy.  2. **Scientific Consensus**: The scientific community has generally considered COVID-19 to be a high consequence infectious disease due to its high transmissibility, the severity of the disease, and the potential for long-term health effects.  3. **Policy Implications**: The classification of COVID-19 as an HCID would have implications for public health measures, such as travel restrictions, quarantine requirements, and the allocation of resources for research, testing, and treatment.  4. **Misinterpretation**: The statement might be misinterpreted by the public, leading to confusion about the seriousness of the disease and the measures that should be taken to prevent its spread.

The text in the image states, "There are 47 counties with zero Obamacare plans signed up for 2018." This statement is not necessarily against common sense, as it is a factual observation based on the data presented in the accompanying map. The map shows counties in various shades of blue, indicating the number of ACA insurers available in each county. The text is providing information about the availability of ACA insurers in these counties for the year 2018.  However, it's important to note that the availability of ACA insurers can be influenced by a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory changes, and the overall health of the insurance market. The statement does not provide context for why these counties have zero plans signed up, so it's not clear whether this is due to a lack of demand, insurers leaving the market, or other factors.
The text in the image appears to be a headline from a news channel, which reads: "PETROL PUMP EMPLOYEE ... Hyderabad accused leaves fuel station."  The headline seems to be a bit confusing and may not be entirely accurate or clear. It mentions a petrol pump employee, which could imply that the employee is accused of a crime, but the text does not specify what the crime is. The mention of "Hyderabad accused" could be referring to a specific case or incident, but without additional context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of the accusation.  The phrase "leaves fuel station" is also a bit unclear. It could mean that the accused person is leaving the fuel station, but it's not clear why this is significant or what the context of the situation is.  The text also includes a quote that says, "...petrol in bottle. So we didn't give him'." This quote seems to be out of context and does not provide any useful information about the situation.  Overall, the text seems to be a bit sensationalized and lacks clarity, which could be misleading to viewers. It's important to rely on credible sources for news and to be cautious about interpreting headlines without additional information.
The text you provided is a quote attributed to Rashida Tlaib, a Democratic lawmaker. The quote is controversial because it uses strong language and is considered inappropriate by many people.

The text in the image appears to be a mix of English and Hindi, with the English word "BOYCOTT" prominently displayed. The Hindi text seems to be a title or a phrase related to the content of the image, which includes a group of people posing together.  The statement "At the time of reporting, the trailer had received ." is not present in the image. It seems like a placeholder or a mistake in the text provided.

The text in the image appears to be in Hindi, and it seems to be discussing the construction of Ram temples. However, without a clear understanding of the context or the specific content of the text, it's difficult to determine if there's anything in the text that goes against common sense.  The text mentions a date and a plan, which might be related to the construction or the agenda of a meeting. It also mentions trust members, which could imply that this is a discussion or decision-making process related to the construction of Ram temples.  If the text is discussing a specific event or plan related to the construction of Ram temples, it's important to consider the context and the credibility of the source to determine if there's anything in the text that goes against common sense.

The statement is about the Democratic Party's representation of Trump's Supreme Court nominees.

The text in the image appears to be a statement about a person's political beliefs, specifically the wearing of a "Make Whites Great Again" hat, which is often associated with certain political ideologies. The statement implies that the person wearing the hat is racist and should not be a police officer.  However, the text does not provide any evidence to support the claim that the person in the image is Derek Chauvin, the police officer who was involved in the death of George Floyd. The image shows a different individual, who is not Derek Chauvin.  The text also does not provide any evidence to support the claim that the person in the image is a police officer. The image shows a different individual who is not a police officer.  Therefore, the text goes against common sense because it makes unsubstantiated claims about the identity and profession of the person in the image.
The text in the image appears to be a quote attributed to Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. The quote seems to be a statement of defiance or assertion of her own dignity in response to the President of the United States. It is a political statement, and whether it goes against common sense would depend on one's perspective on the situation and the context of the quote.  In general, the quote does not seem to go against common sense in terms of grammar or syntax. It is a coherent sentence that conveys a message. However, whether the message itself is in line with common sense or not would depend on the specific context and the opinions of the individuals involved.

The text in the image states, "Fasting, prayers cured coronavirus President declares Tanzania free." This statement is not supported by scientific evidence and goes against common sense.  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by a virus, and there is no scientific evidence to suggest that fasting or prayers can cure the disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) and other health organizations recommend following public health guidelines, such as hand hygiene, social distancing, and wearing masks, to prevent the spread of the virus.  The statement made by the President of Tanzania, as reported in the image, is not in line with the scientific consensus on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

The headline translates to "Hong Kong police use excessive force," which is a statement that could be interpreted in various ways depending on the context of the situation.  Without additional context, it's difficult to determine if the statement is accurate or if it goes against common sense. The image itself shows a person lying on the ground, and there is a person standing over them, which could be interpreted as excessive force being used. However, without more information, it's not possible to make a definitive judgment about the situation.  It's important to note that the interpretation of such images can be subjective and may vary depending on the viewer's perspective and understanding of the context.
The text in the image appears to be in Arabic, and it seems to be a description or commentary related to the image. However, without knowing the context or the specific content of the text, it is difficult to determine if it goes against common sense.  The image itself shows a person lying on a bed with bandages on their head and arm, suggesting that they have been injured. The presence of blood on the bed and the person's apparent distress indicate that they have been through a traumatic experience.  It is important to approach such images with sensitivity and to avoid making assumptions or drawing conclusions based on a single image or text. The situation depicted in the image is likely to be a complex and tragic one, and it is important to consider the broader context and to seek out reliable sources of information to gain a more complete understanding of the events that led to this situation.

The text provided in the image appears to be a statement made by the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, regarding the arrest of Maria Butina in the United States. The statement is consistent with the common sense understanding that when someone is arrested, it is generally considered a serious matter, and the call for her release suggests that the Russian government believes she has been unjustly detained.  However, without more context or information about the specific charges against Maria Butina, it is not possible to determine from the text alone whether the charges are fabricated or not. This would require an investigation into the circumstances of her arrest and the evidence supporting the charges.  It is important to note that the text is a news headline and may not provide the full context of the situation.

The text in the image appears to be a screenshot of a webpage with a news article. The article discusses the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and reports that it has received over 12,000 reports of deaths related to COVID-19 vaccines.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The VAERS system is a passive surveillance system that collects reports of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) in the United States. It is important to note that the number of reports received by VAERS does not necessarily mean that the vaccine caused the death, as it is a passive reporting system and not all adverse events are reported. Additionally, the number of reports does not provide information on the actual number of deaths or the causality between the vaccine and the reported deaths.  It is also worth noting that the COVID-19 vaccines have undergone rigorous testing and have been shown to be safe and effective in preventing severe illness and death from COVID-19. The benefits of getting vaccinated against COVID-19 far outweigh the risks, and it is recommended by public health authorities to get vaccinated.

It also states that there have been 10,000 people vaccinated, with 2,400 people fully vaccinated.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The information provided seems to be factual and consistent with what one would expect from a public health update. The text is clear and provides specific numbers and details about the COVID-19 situation in Navajo Nation.
The text in the image reads, "Wuhuan-Coronavirus it wasn't me." This statement is a play on words, suggesting that the Wuhan Coronavirus was not caused by Wuhan, which is the city where the outbreak of the virus was first reported. The statement is not factual and is likely intended to be humorous or satirical. It does not go against common sense in the sense of being logically inconsistent or contradictory, but it is a form of dark humor that plays on the seriousness of the pandemic.
The text in the image appears to be a headline or a caption, and it reads: "Though the Covid variant first found in the U.K. has been found in the U.S., the U.S. has not yet reported any cases of the variant."  This statement is not against common sense. It is a factual observation about the status of the Covid variant first identified in the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7, or the "Kent variant") in the United States. The text is reporting that while the variant has been identified in the U.S., there have been no reported cases of the variant in the U.S. at the time the image was taken or the text was written. This is a straightforward statement of the current state of the variant's presence in the U.S.
The text in the image states, "Undocummented immigrants pay billion a year in taxes." This statement is generally considered to be true. Undocumented immigrants, also known as illegal immigrants, do contribute to the U.S. economy and tax system. They often pay taxes on their income, even though they may not have valid Social Security numbers. However, they do not receive the same benefits as U.S. citizens, such as Social Security retirement benefits or unemployment insurance. The statement is not going against common sense; it is a fact that undocumented immigrants do contribute to the U.S. tax system.
The text in the image appears to be a fact check statement from ABC News. It states that Vice President Pence claimed that less than 10 cents on the dollar in the Clinton Foundation went to charitable causes. The fact check indicates that this claim is "FALSE."  The statement goes against common sense because it implies that the Clinton Foundation was highly inefficient, with the vast majority of its funds not being used for charitable purposes. However, the fact check suggests that this is not the case, and the actual percentage of funds going to charitable causes is likely to be higher than 10 cents on the dollar.  The fact check is a response to a statement made by Vice President Pence, which is a public claim that has been scrutinized and found to be inaccurate. It is important for public figures to be accurate with their statements, especially when they are making claims about the actions of others.
The text in the image states, "At least , health care workers worldwide have been infected with COVID so far, but the number could be twice as high." This statement is not going against common sense.

The text provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It accurately describes the situation depicted in the image, which shows a map of the Southern Hemisphere with areas of active fires marked in red. The text also mentions that there are fires near Sydney and Canberra in Australia, which is consistent with the image. The statement about fires exceeding a certain number in Australia is also consistent with the image, which shows a concentration of red dots indicating the location of fires.
The text in the image appears to describe a situation where Indian police are firing upon peaceful protesters. The context provided suggests that the protesters are demonstrating against a law that is perceived as anti-Muslim. The text also mentions that the law in question snatches citizenship from Muslims due to their religious identity.  The statement "JharkhandResults CAANRCProtests BBCUrdu amnesty" seems to be a combination of different elements that may not be directly related to each other. "JharkhandResults" could refer to an event or outcome in the state of Jharkhand, "CAANRCProtests" might be a specific protest or movement, and "BBCUrdu amnesty" could be a reference to a news report or a call for amnesty in the Urdu language.  Without additional context, it's difficult to determine the accuracy or relevance of the text. However, the statement that the law snatches citizenship from Muslims due to their religious identity is a controversial and sensitive issue that has been widely debated and criticized. It's important to approach such topics with care and to verify information from credible sources.
The text you provided seems to be discussing the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Wuhan Institute of Virology. It mentions the Chinese government's refusal to allow independent journalists or investigators into Wuhan and the theory that the coronavirus leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  The statement "The Chinese government's refusal to allow independent journalists or investigators into Wuhan, coupled with evidence that the coronavirus passed through but didn't start in the Wuhan market, fuels the theory it leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology." is a logical conclusion based on the information provided. It suggests a causal relationship between the Chinese government's actions and the theory about the virus's origin.  However, it's important to note that the theory about the coronavirus originating from the Wuhan Institute of Virology is still a subject of scientific debate and investigation. While there is evidence that the virus was present in Wuhan before the first reported cases, the exact source of the virus is not yet conclusively determined.  The text does not contain anything that goes against common sense. It presents a coherent argument based on the information available at the time the text was written.
The text you provided is a statement about the increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes for adults with Down syndrome. This statement is based on scientific research and is consistent with common sense, as it reflects the fact that individuals with Down syndrome often have underlying health conditions that can weaken their immune systems and make them more vulnerable to severe illness.
The text in the image does not provide any information about Trump implying Putin used the N-word when talking about Obama. The text only mentions that Trump and Obama are shown side by side in the image. The statement about Trump implying Putin used the N-word is not supported by the text in the image.
The text provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It describes a situation where a village has been burned down, which is a serious and unfortunate event. The text also mentions that at least two people have died, which is a tragic outcome of the clashes between the security forces and local guerrillas. The information in the text is consistent with what one would expect to read in a news report about such an event.
The text in the image appears to be a statement made by a person, likely a politician or a public figure, during a press conference or a similar event. The statement seems to be a commentary on a geopolitical situation, specifically the situation in Syria involving US-led forces.  The statement itself does not go against common sense. It is a statement that could be made by someone who is discussing the events in Syria and the involvement of various parties, including the US-led forces.  However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine the accuracy or veracity of the statement. It is important to note that statements made by public figures can be subject to interpretation and may not always be based on factual information. It is always advisable to seek out multiple sources of information and to verify statements with credible sources before drawing conclusions.
The text in the image appears to be a headline or a statement that is meant to be sensational or attention-grabbing. It suggests that Cristiano Ronaldo's actions caused Coca-Cola's market value to drop by a billion dollars.  However, this statement goes against common sense because it is highly unlikely that the actions of a single individual, even a high-profile athlete like Cristiano Ronaldo, could have such a significant impact on a company's market value. Market values are influenced by a multitude of factors, including economic conditions, investor sentiment, and company performance, among others. It is not reasonable to attribute a billion-dollar drop in market value to a single event or individual.  The text is likely meant to be humorous or satirical, playing on the idea that Ronaldo's actions might have had some influence on Coca-Cola's market value, but the exaggeration is not supported by any credible financial analysis.
The text you provided seems to be a description of an image or a scene, rather than a statement that goes against common sense. It appears to be a factual description of a Mars rover landing, which is a significant event in space exploration.  However, if you are referring to the image itself, it is not clear what you mean by "stunning images of Mars landing." If the image is supposed to show the landing of the Perseverance rover on Mars, but it does not, then it could be considered misleading or inaccurate.  If you are referring to the news text, it is not clear what part of the text you find to be against common sense. The text appears to be a straightforward description of an event, and without additional context, it is difficult to determine if there is anything in the text that goes against common sense.
The text in the image is a play on words, using the acronym "PTSD" to represent "President Trump Stress Disorder." The statement "President Trump Stress Disorder" is a humorous take on the political climate and the stress that some people may feel due to the political environment.  The statement "Trump just attacked America's vets by calling those suffering from PTSD weak!" is a separate statement that is not directly related to the acronym "PTSD" in the image. It is a commentary on a specific political event or statement made by President Trump.  The statement "Trump just attacked America's vets by calling those suffering from PTSD weak!" is a subjective interpretation of an event or statement, and whether it goes against common sense would depend on one's perspective on the situation. Some might argue that it is not appropriate to criticize veterans, while others might see it as a legitimate critique of a political figure's actions or words.
The text you provided does not seem to go against common sense. It discusses the Zika virus and its potential impact on pregnant women and their babies, which is a legitimate concern. The text also mentions activists pushing for legal abortions in Brazil, which is a topic of debate and discussion in many countries.

The image shows two individuals, one wearing a pink shirt and the other in a blue shirt, interacting with a suitcase. The text "China Govt." is present in the image, but without additional context, it's unclear how this text relates to the scene.  The text "China Govt." does not inherently go against common sense. However, if the text is meant to imply that the government is involved in the actions of the individuals in the image, it could be interpreted as unusual or unexpected, depending on the context.  Without more information, it's not possible to determine if the text is accurate or if it's being used in a way that is misleading or inappropriate.

The statement is consistent with what one might expect in a challenging economic environment or during times of high unemployment.
The text in the image appears to be in Hindi, and it seems to be discussing a tragic event involving a sadhu (a religious figure) who was killed in Nanded. The text mentions that the sadhu was killed after the Palghar mob lynching, which is a reference to a violent incident that occurred in April 2020 in Palghar, Maharashtra, India, where two sadhus and a local resident were attacked and killed by a mob.  The text does not contain anything that goes against common sense. It is a statement of fact, reporting on a recent event. However, it is important to note that the image itself is a composite of two different photographs, with the sadhu's face superimposed onto the body of another person. This kind of manipulation is often done for sensational or misleading purposes, which can be against common sense and ethical journalism standards.
The text in the image appears to be in Hindi, and it reads: "सबका साथ है सबका समान है सबका समान है सबका समान है सबका समान है सबका समान है सबका समान है सबका समान है सबका समान है सबका समान है सबका समान है सबका समान है सबका समान है सबका समान है सबका समान है सबका समान है सबका समान है सबका समान है सबका समान है सबका समान है सबका समान है सबका समान ह

It mentions that the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, has inaugurated the Atal Tunnel at Rohtang in Himachal Pradesh, which is claimed to be the world's longest highway tunnel.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a factual statement about an event that took place and a claim about the length of the tunnel. However, it is important to note that the veracity of the claim about the tunnel being the world's longest would need to be verified by reliable sources, as such claims are often subject to scrutiny and may require independent verification.
The text provided does not seem to go against common sense. It describes a group of Rajya Sabha MPs visiting farmers who are protesting against the Bills in different districts of Amethi. The presence of a group of people wearing masks suggests that they are taking precautions against the spread of a contagious disease, which is a common sense measure in many parts of the world.

The statement is that President Trump believes Cuomo never asked Blumenthal about Blumenthal's claim of serving in Vietnam.  The statement is not inherently against common sense. It is a statement about an event that took place, which is a common type of statement. However, the accuracy of the statement would depend on the context of the press conference and the specific circumstances surrounding the interaction between Cuomo and Blumenthal.  It's important to note that the truthfulness of a statement made by a public figure is not always immediately clear and often requires further investigation to determine its accuracy.
The image you've provided appears to be a screenshot of a map showing the region of Israel and Palestine. The text overlay on the image seems to be a statement about the existence of Palestine, which is a topic of ongoing political and territorial disputes.  The statement "Google and Apple Maps removed Palestine will always exist no matter what others do" is a subjective opinion and not a factual statement. It is true that some maps and mapping services have not included Palestine as a separate entity, but this is a political decision and not a reflection of the existence or non-existence of Palestine as a geographical entity.  The statement is not inherently against common sense, but it is a statement that reflects a political stance and is not a universally accepted fact. It is important to note that the political status of Palestine is a complex and contentious issue, and different people and organizations may have different perspectives on the matter.
The text in the image appears to be a fact-checking article from Reuters, which is a reputable news organization. The article is discussing the claim that COVID-19 vaccines are not experimental.  The text states: "Corrected-Fact Check-COVID-19 vaccines are not experimental and they have not skipped trial stages."  This statement is factually correct. COVID-19 vaccines have gone through rigorous clinical trials, which are a standard part of the process for developing new vaccines. These trials are designed to test the safety and efficacy of the vaccine before it is approved for use. The fact that the vaccines have been authorized for emergency use by regulatory agencies like the FDA in the United States indicates that they have been through a thorough review of the clinical trial data.  Therefore, the statement in the text is not going against common sense. It is a factual statement based on the information available at the time the article was published.
The text provided does not seem to go against common sense. It describes an image of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi addressing a crowd of army men in Leh, which is a location in the Himalayan region of India.

The text you've provided seems to be a statement about taxation, specifically mentioning former U.S. President Donald Trump and undocumented immigrants. The statement is a bit ambiguous and could be interpreted in different ways.  The first part of the statement, "Trump paid no income tax for yrs," is a factual statement that has been widely reported. It is true that President Trump did not pay income taxes for several years, as reported by The New York Times in 2018.  The second part of the statement, "undocumented immigrants pay B of taxes every single year!" is a bit more complex. It is generally true that undocumented immigrants do pay taxes, but the amount they pay can vary. Some undocumented immigrants may pay taxes on their earned income, while others may not be required to file taxes. The statement seems to be suggesting that undocumented immigrants pay a significant amount of taxes, which is not necessarily accurate.  The statement also includes a reminder that while Trump paid no income tax, undocumented immigrants pay taxes. This is a valid point, as it highlights the fact that undocumented immigrants contribute to the U.S. tax system despite their immigration status.  Overall, the statement is making a comparison between the tax-paying behavior of a former president and undocumented immigrants, which is a valid comparison. However, the statement could be more precise in its
The text "Ahora se habla de la twindemic la doble pandemia Covid e inlfuenza A fall 'twindemic'" is a play on words, combining the terms "twindemic" (which is not a real term) and "pandemic" to create a humorous or exaggerated concept. It is not a serious statement about a real phenomenon.  The images you've provided appear to be sketches or drawings of animated characters, each holding a different musical instrument. The characters are stylized and do not represent real people. The text does not provide any information that goes against common sense or is factually incorrect. It is simply a creative or humorous expression.
The image you've provided appears to show a person with a bandage over their eyes, which could be indicative of an injury or medical treatment. The text you've provided seems to be a statement about the Indian Army's actions in Kashmir.  The statement "Indian Army is terrorising kashmiris with all kind of human rights violations and abuse" is a subjective opinion and is not a factual statement. It is a political statement that reflects a particular perspective on the situation in Kashmir.  Whether or not the Indian Army has been involved in human rights violations and abuse in Kashmir is a matter of ongoing debate and investigation. There have been numerous reports and allegations of human rights abuses in the region, but it is important to note that these are complex issues with many different perspectives and sources of information.  It is crucial to approach such topics with an understanding of the complexity of the situation and to seek out reliable, factual information from credible sources.
The image contains a series of statements in Hindi, which appear to be related to political or social commentary. However, without understanding the context or the full content of the statements, it's difficult to determine if any of the statements go against common sense. The statements seem to be making a point about the UPA (United Progressive Alliance) government's policies and actions, but without more information, it's not possible to assess the accuracy or reasonableness of the claims.
The text you provided seems to be a sensationalized or exaggerated description of an event. It mentions a "Trump Train" caravan that is described as targeting black communities, which is a serious accusation. However, without more context or evidence, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of this claim.  The phrase "It Was Like the Taliban Had Come to Town" is a hyperbolic statement, suggesting a level of chaos or intimidation that is not supported by the image. The image shows a line of vehicles with flags on the back, which could be interpreted as a display of patriotism or political support.  It's important to approach such claims with a critical eye and to seek out reliable sources of information to ensure that any statements made are based on factual evidence.
The text in the image states: "COVID-19 UPDATE: WHO had declared that COVID is now on pandemic stage."  This statement is not accurate according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO has indeed declared COVID-19 a pandemic, but it did so on March 11, 2020, not on March 19, as stated in the image. The image appears to be a screenshot from a news source, and the date in the image is incorrect.  The text in the image is not consistent with the timeline of the WHO's declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic. Therefore, the text goes against common sense and the accurate reporting of events.
The text you provided is a statement that is not supported by any credible evidence. It is a conspiracy theory that has been debunked by numerous fact-checking organizations. The phrase "Gorka Lone Wolf terrorists" is not a recognized term and has no basis in reality. It is not a phrase invented by the Obama team or anyone else, and it is not a legitimate way to describe terrorists or any other group of people.  The statement is an example of misinformation and is not based on facts. It is important to be cautious about sharing or believing in unsubstantiated claims, as they can spread misinformation and contribute to the spread of false information.
The text in the image appears to be a description of a location, but it is not clear what "Artic" refers to. The text mentions "Russia amp," which is not a standard geographical term and does not correspond to any widely recognized geographical entity. It seems to be a typographical error or a misnomer.  The image shows a vast, open landscape with a clear blue sky and what appears to be a flat, barren terrain, which could be a desert or a high-altitude plateau. However, without more context or information, it is difficult to determine the exact location or the significance of the text.  The text "This is the sight at Artic which is between Russia amp" does not make sense in the context of the image and does not provide any useful information. It seems to be a nonsensical or incorrect statement.
The text in the image states, "This is what the coronavirus does to the human body." The image shows a stylized representation of a human body with various organs highlighted, and there are particles that appear to be viruses floating around the body.  The statement is not necessarily against common sense, as it is a factual description of the effects of the coronavirus on the human body. The image is likely intended to be educational, illustrating how the virus can cause damage to different organs.  However, it's important to note that the image is a stylized representation and not a real-life photograph. It is designed to convey information in a visual format, and while it may not be an exact scientific illustration, it is generally accurate in its depiction of the potential effects of the coronavirus on the human body.  If there is something specific in the text or the image that you believe goes against common sense, please provide more details, and I can comment further.
The text in the image appears to be a statement made by a person, which seems to be a call for action or a statement of intent. It reads: "He (Mahmoud Abbas) needs to step down."  This statement is a political opinion and does not inherently go against common sense. It is a commentary on the leadership of Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority, and suggests that the speaker believes he should resign from his position.  However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine the accuracy or appropriateness of this statement. It's important to consider the source of the statement and the circumstances surrounding it. If the statement is made by a credible source and is based on factual information, it might be seen as a reasonable opinion. If it's made without proper evidence or is part of a larger political agenda, it could be seen as less credible or even as an attempt to manipulate public opinion.
The text you provided is a statement attributed to Joe Biden, and it appears to be a direct quote from a news source. The statement is about Elizabeth Warren's Medicare for All plan and suggests that it would require a trillion-dollar tax hike on the middle class.  Whether or not this statement is accurate or goes against common sense would depend on the context of the plan and the specifics of the taxation proposal. It's important to consider the source of the information and the credibility of the news outlet. Additionally, the statement should be evaluated in light of the broader policy discussion and the potential implications for taxpayers and the healthcare system.  It's worth noting that political statements can be subject to interpretation and may not always align with the perspectives of all individuals. Therefore, it's crucial to critically evaluate such statements and consider multiple sources of information when forming an opinion on political matters.
The text in the image appears to be a summary of guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regarding COVID-19 vaccinations and social interactions. It states that fully vaccinated individuals can gather in small groups without masks, but they should continue to wear masks in public spaces outside their homes.  This guidance is consistent with the CDC's recommendations for fully vaccinated individuals, which are based on scientific evidence and public health considerations. The CDC's guidance is designed to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, especially among unvaccinated individuals who are at higher risk of severe illness and death from the virus.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense, as it is a summary of official public health guidance from a reputable organization. The CDC's recommendations are based on the best available scientific evidence and are intended to help protect public health.
The image shows a chart titled "Australian unemployment measures" with data for the share of the labour force that is unemployed. The chart indicates that the unemployment rate has been relatively stable over the past five years, with some fluctuations.  The text in the image states: "This measure includes those with a marginal attachment to the labour force, such as discouraged workers."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The statement is clear and accurate, indicating that the unemployment rate includes individuals who are not actively seeking work but are available for work and have looked for work in the past 12 months. This is a standard way of measuring unemployment, as it captures a broader range of individuals who are not currently employed but are potentially available for work.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline discussing an incident involving a Hindu Sadhu Saint being killed in Nagthane, Nanded district. The headline suggests that the Sadhu Saint was killed for reasons that are not yet known. The text also mentions a previous incident in Palghar where two Sadhus were killed.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The headline is reporting on a tragic event and is likely intended to raise awareness about the incident and possibly to question the safety of Hindu Sadhu Saints in the region. The text is factual and does not contain any information that is obviously false or contradicts common sense.
The text "Kashmir Infiltration Indian Army Neutralises Pakistan's BAT Attempt" appears to be a headline or a summary of an event. The text itself does not go against common sense. It describes a situation where the Indian Army has reportedly neutralized an attempt by Pakistan's Border Action Team (BAT) to infiltrate into Indian-administered Kashmir.  However, without additional context, it's not possible to determine the accuracy or credibility of the news report. It's important to verify news sources and cross-check information from multiple reliable sources before drawing conclusions.
The text you provided seems to be a statement about media exposure of alleged torture cells in occupied Kashmir by the Indian Army. However, without additional context or information, it's difficult to determine if the statement is accurate or if it goes against common sense.  The statement is a generalization and does not provide specific details or evidence to support the claim. It's important to critically evaluate such statements and consider the credibility of the sources and the evidence presented.  If the statement is based on credible sources and there is evidence to support the claim, then it would be reasonable to consider it. However, if the statement is based on unverified information or is presented in a sensational or biased manner, it would be prudent to approach it with caution.
The text in the image is a statement about the COVID-19 vaccine, which is not mandatory in many places. It suggests that getting vaccinated is a way to protect oneself, loved ones, and others from the virus. This statement is consistent with common sense and public health recommendations, which encourage vaccination as a means of reducing the spread of infectious diseases and protecting vulnerable populations.
The text in the image states: "S protein f. 19 Feb 20. 25mM NaPi. pH 7.5 0.3mL/kg/h. 116 PBS, ph 7.5 0.3mL/kg/h."  This text appears to be a description of a solution used in a medical or scientific context, likely related to the coronavirus. It mentions the concentration of sodium phosphate (NaPi) and the pH of the solution, as well as the volume of the solution per kilogram per hour.

The text provided appears to be a news headline or summary, and it does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It describes a situation where a person named Daunte Wright is alleged to have committed a crime, which is consistent with the typical reporting of criminal activity. The headline also mentions that Wright had a warrant out for his arrest, which is a standard procedure in law enforcement when an individual is suspected of committing a crime and is not in custody.  The text does not provide any additional context or details that would be considered unusual or counter to common sense. It is a straightforward report of an alleged criminal act and the subsequent law enforcement response.
The text in the image appears to be a headline from a news source, which seems to be reporting on a statement made by former US President Donald Trump. The headline suggests that Trump is alleging that Iran killed a scientist due to Hillary Clinton's emails.  The statement that Iran killed a scientist because of Hillary Clinton's emails is not supported by any credible evidence and is not a widely accepted fact. It is a baseless conspiracy theory that has been debunked by numerous reputable news sources and fact-checking organizations.  The claim that Iran killed a scientist due to Hillary Clinton's emails is not consistent with common sense or the known facts about the situation. It is a politically motivated statement that is not based on any verifiable information.
The image you've provided appears to be a political cartoon, which is a form of satire that uses humor or exaggeration to comment on current events or political issues. The cartoon is making a statement about the political stance of a certain individual, which is a common practice in political cartoons.  The text in the cartoon includes phrases like "Make America Hate Again," "World Opinion," and "Third Times a Charm." These phrases are likely meant to be humorous or critical, reflecting the cartoonist's perspective on the individual's policies or actions.  The statement "Trump wants to take the oil in Iraq" is a simplification of a complex geopolitical issue. It is true that the United States has had a long history of involvement in Iraq, often related to oil resources. However, the cartoon is likely using this statement as a metaphor or a shorthand way to represent the broader context of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East.  Whether or not the statement "Trump wants to take the oil in Iraq" is factually accurate is not the point of the cartoon. The cartoon is using this statement as a part of its satirical commentary.
The text "GEORGIA OUTLAWS PIZZA!" is a play on words, suggesting that Georgia has made a law against outlaw pizza. However, this is not a real law and is likely a humorous or exaggerated statement. It is not something that goes against common sense, as it is a fictional scenario created for comedic effect.
The text provided does not seem to go against common sense. It describes a situation where Indian troops are using force against protesters in Srinagar, which is consistent with the images showing a group of people, some of whom are wearing helmets and carrying what appear to be weapons, confronting a group of Indian soldiers. The presence of smoke and the chaotic nature of the scene suggest that there is a conflict or confrontation taking place. The text accurately reflects the visual content of the image.
The text in the image appears to be a statement about the sale of uranium to Russia by the Clinton Foundation. It suggests that the sale was made at a time when the Obama administration approved the sale of 20 percent of US uranium to Russia.  The statement is not inherently against common sense, as it is a factual statement about events that occurred. However, the text does not provide any additional context or evidence to support the claim that the sale was made at the time of the Obama administration's approval.  It is important to note that the Clinton Foundation has been the subject of numerous investigations and allegations, some of which have been found to be without merit. However, without further information or evidence, it is not possible to determine the accuracy of the statement made in the text.
The text in the image is a fact check from The New York Times, which states that President Trump made a claim that North Korea took billions of dollars during the Clinton administration for nothing. The fact check indicates that this claim is not supported by evidence and is likely false.  The statement "according to the pictures and news text" is not relevant to the fact check, as the fact check is based on the information provided by The New York Times, which is a reputable news source. The fact check itself is a statement of fact, not an opinion or interpretation.  Therefore, there is nothing in the text that goes against common sense, as it is a fact check based on verifiable information.
The text in the image appears to be a list of airline names, including "HUNGER STATION," "STYLI," "ASD," "AAA," "KAA," "MMM," "RIVA iHERB," "A2," "AUC9914," "PPP," and "LUX39."

The text is consistent with the visual content of the image, which shows a soldier in military attire standing on a rocky outcrop with a backdrop of a mountainous area.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a caption, and it reads: "A Spanish biological researcher."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense.

The text in the image discusses the "Event 201" Pandemic Exercise: Segment 1 (MCC) Discussion, which took place on October 18, 2019. The text mentions that the exercise was hosted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  The text also states that the exercise was designed to illustrate the pandemic preparedness efforts needed to diminish the impact of a future pandemic. It is important to note that the exercise was a simulation and not a real event.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The exercise was designed to prepare for potential future pandemics, which is a responsible and proactive approach to public health. The fact that the exercise took place before the COVID-19 pandemic was declared suggests that it was not a cause of the pandemic but rather a response to the ongoing threat of pandemics.  The image also includes a screenshot of a YouTube video, which is likely related to the exercise or the topic of pandemics. The video has been viewed 309,564 times, and there are 734 subscribers, indicating that the content is of interest to many viewers.  The text and the image do not provide any information that would contradict common sense or established scientific and public health principles.
The text in the image states: "Close to million people took to Hong Kong's streets on Sunday, according to the organizers of the protest against a controversial extradition bill."  This statement is not in line with common sense because it is highly unlikely that a city like Hong Kong could accommodate such a large crowd. The population of Hong Kong is approximately 7.5 million, and it is not feasible for that many people to gather in one place without significant logistical challenges. Additionally, the image shows a large crowd, but it is not possible to determine the exact number of people present without more context or a clearer view of the entire protest area.  The text is likely an exaggeration or a misinterpretation of the actual number of protesters, which is a common occurrence in media reporting on large public gatherings.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a social media post. It mentions a new health order in Michigan that eliminates the table limit in restaurants and allows dance floors, pool tables, and other similar areas to reopen.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The headline is informing people about a change in health regulations, which is a typical function of news media. The text is clear and does not contain any contradictory or nonsensical statements.
The text "Caught on camera Autonomous robot destroyed by selfdriving Tesla" is a sensational and misleading statement. It suggests that an autonomous robot was destroyed by a self-driving Tesla, which is not a typical occurrence and is not supported by the image provided.  The image shows a man standing next to a robot, which appears to be a humanoid robot with a screen displaying what looks like a webpage or a graphical user interface. There is no indication in the image that the robot was destroyed by a Tesla vehicle.  The text is likely intended to be humorous or satirical, playing on the fear and skepticism surrounding autonomous vehicles and robots. However, it is important to note that such a scenario is not supported by the image and is not a real event.
The image you've provided appears to be a screenshot from a television broadcast, specifically from the Fox News channel. The text on the screen indicates that the segment is discussing a topic related to "tight shot," which could refer to a specific news story or a metaphorical concept.  The text "Fox News accidentally puts up a poll graphic that shows how they are the least trusted network" is not present in the image. The text on the screen is "TIGHT SHOT," which seems to be the title or a description of the segment's content.  Without additional context, it's not possible to determine if the segment is discussing the trustworthiness of Fox News or if there's any other information that might be considered against common sense. The image does not provide enough information to make such a determination.
The text in the image reads: "Farmers protesting at the DelhiGhazipur border march towards Delhi." This statement is consistent with the visual content of the image, which shows a large group of people, likely farmers, gathered at the border of Delhi and marching towards the city. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense based on the image provided.
The text in the image appears to be a political statement or a campaign promise related to tax reform. It states:  "The House Republican Tax Reform Blueprint 70,4423 New full-time jobs $5,256 Increase in income for median households"  The numbers provided seem to be related to the economic impact of the tax reform plan. The first number, 70,442, is likely a reference to the number of new full-time jobs created by the plan. The second number, $5,256, is probably the estimated increase in income for median households.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward statement of the economic benefits that the House Republican Tax Reform Blueprint is expected to provide. However, it is important to note that such claims are often subject to scrutiny and may require further analysis to determine their accuracy.
The text "Floods destroy homes, trap families in cyclonehit Mozambique" is consistent with the image provided. The image shows two people, possibly a woman and a child, wading through a flooded area, which is consistent with the description of homes being destroyed and families being trapped by floods. The presence of a cyclone suggests that the flooding is likely the result of a severe weather event, which is consistent with the news text. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense based on the image provided.
The text in the image appears to be a headline from a news show, which reads: "BREAKING NEWS: The Moneycontrol Show BREAKING NEWS." This is a bit redundant, as the word "BREAKING" is repeated twice, which is not typical for news headlines. However, there is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It seems to be a standard news headline announcing a breaking news story.
The text in the image is a humorous and fictional statement that goes against common sense. It suggests that wearing a mask made out of cloth without a filter can make a person immune to coronavirus and all diseases, which is not true. In reality, cloth masks without filters do not provide adequate protection against airborne particles, including viruses, and are not considered effective in preventing the spread of diseases like COVID-19. Additionally, the text mentions a mask that makes the wearer immune to sunlight, which is not a real thing and is purely a fantasy or a joke. The statement about being insanely obsessed with the Joestar family is also a fictional and humorous comment, not a factual one.
The text in the image appears to be a statement about the recognition of Juan Guaidó as the legitimate leader of Venezuela by the United States and other countries. The statement is consistent with the political situation in Venezuela, where Guaidó has declared himself the interim president and has been recognized as such by several countries, including the United States.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense, as it accurately reflects the international response to the political crisis in Venezuela. The statement is based on the fact that the United States and other countries have recognized Guaidó as the legitimate leader, which is a position that has been widely reported in the media and is consistent with the actions of these governments.
The text in the image attributes a statement to Donald J. Trump that is not accurate. The statement is that Clapper admitted to paying large dollars to spy on the Trump campaign. This is not true. Clapper has publicly stated that he did not pay large dollars to spy on the Trump campaign. The statement is a false claim, which is not supported by the facts.
The text provided in the image does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It is a factual statement about the Israeli Air Force naming a fighter plane after an Indian nurse who died in a Hamas rocket attack. The text is consistent with what has been reported in various news sources.
The text in the image states, "Trump again falsely claims he opposed the Iraq War before the invasion." This statement is factual and does not go against common sense. It is a widely reported fact that Donald Trump has made false claims about opposing the Iraq War before the invasion. The statement is based on the evidence that Trump did not publicly oppose the war before it began, despite his later claims to the contrary.
The text in the image appears to be a screenshot of a social media post with a caption that seems to be critical of a political figure. The caption suggests that the person in the image is attending a rally and is part of a group that is trying to remove the headgear of a Muslim man. The text also mentions that the person is a "Kissan Rally," which is a reference to a political rally in India.  The text itself does not contain anything that goes against common sense. It is a statement of fact, describing an event and the actions of individuals at that event. However, the interpretation of the event and the implications drawn from it may be subject to personal opinions and biases.  The image itself shows a person sitting on the floor, and there is no clear evidence of any action being taken to remove the headgear of another person. The context of the event and the actions of the individuals involved are not fully clear from the image alone.  It's important to approach such posts with a critical eye, considering the source of the information and the potential for misinformation or bias.
The text "India found its missing Vikram lunar lander" is a statement that seems to be in line with common sense, as it reports a significant event in space exploration. The Vikram lunar lander is indeed a spacecraft that was sent by India to the Moon, and it was reported missing after a hard landing on the lunar surface. The statement that India found the lander is consistent with the fact that such a discovery would be a major achievement for the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and the global space community.  However, without additional context, it's not possible to determine the accuracy of the statement. It's important to verify such news reports with reliable sources to ensure that the information is accurate and not misleading.
The text in the image appears to be a screenshot from a social media platform, and it contains a statement that seems to be a conspiracy theory. The statement reads: "Americans attending the Wuhan Military Games are spreading the virus."  This statement goes against common sense and scientific understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified the Wuhan Seafood Market as the epicenter of the initial outbreak of COVID-19, and there is no credible evidence to suggest that the virus was deliberately spread by any group, including the United States military.  The claim that the virus was deliberately spread by the US military is a conspiracy theory that has been widely debunked by health experts and fact-checking organizations. The spread of such theories can be harmful, as it can lead to fear, panic, and misinformation, which can exacerbate the public health crisis.  It's important to rely on credible sources of information, such as the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for accurate and up-to-date information about the COVID-19 pandemic.
The text in the image appears to be a timestamp and a camera ID, which are typical elements found in CCTV footage. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The timestamp indicates the time the footage was captured, and the camera ID likely refers to the specific camera from which the footage was taken. The rest of the image shows a view of a rooftop area with various structures, which is consistent with what one might expect to see in a CCTV feed from a high vantage point.
The text in the image appears to be a description of a painting that is considered offensive by some due to its depiction of Lord Krishna in a manner that is not consistent with traditional religious representations. The text suggests that the artist, Akram Shah, has created this painting under a special amendment, which is likely a reference to the Indian Penal Code, where Section 295A prohibits the deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs.  The statement that the painting is "obscene, derogatory, insulting, hateful, blasphemous" is subjective and reflects the viewer's perspective on the artwork. It is important to note that art is often subject to interpretation and can evoke a wide range of reactions from different individuals.  The text does not provide any information that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward description of a painting and its artist, along with the context in which the painting was created.
The text in the image appears to be a tweet from the World Health Organization (WHO) discussing the preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities into the origins of the coronavirus. The text states that the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) in Wuhan, China, as of the year 2019.  The text does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It is a factual statement based on the information available at the time the tweet was posted. The WHO is a reputable organization that provides health information and guidance, and their tweet is consistent with their mission to promote global health.  It's important to note that the investigation into the origins of the coronavirus is ongoing, and the understanding of the virus and its transmission has evolved over time. The WHO's statement reflects the knowledge available at the time the tweet was posted, and it is possible that further investigations have since revealed more about the virus's origins and transmission.
The text in the image is a humorous and fictional statement that goes against common sense. It suggests that wearing a mask made out of cloth without a filter can make a person immune to coronavirus and all diseases, which is not true. In reality, cloth masks without filters do not provide adequate protection against airborne particles, including viruses, and are not considered effective in preventing the spread of diseases like COVID-19. Additionally, the text mentions a mask that makes the wearer immune to sunlight, which is not a real or scientifically supported concept. The statement about being insanely obsessed with the Joestar family is also a fictional and humorous exaggeration.
The text in the image appears to be a poll question asking if people would boycott Chinese goods in response to rising border tensions. The options provided are:  1. Yes, regardless of the cost to me. 2. Yes, as much as possible. 3. No, this has nothing to do with the border conflict.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The question is clear and the options are straightforward, allowing for a simple yes/no/other response. The poll results are also presented in a clear and understandable manner.

The text you provided appears to be a headline from a news source. It seems to be a statement about the political climate in Georgia, specifically regarding the claims of a rigged election and the potential impact on the Senate race.  The text itself does not go against common sense. It is a factual statement about the political situation in Georgia. However, the interpretation of the situation and the implications for the Senate race are subject to individual perspectives and political opinions.  It's important to note that the text does not provide any evidence to support or refute the claims of a rigged election. The statement is based on the context of the news story, which may include additional information not visible in the image.  In general, it's crucial to critically evaluate news sources and the information they present, as well as to consider the potential biases or agendas of the news organization.
The text you've provided does not seem to go against common sense. It is a factual statement based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States.

The text in the image states: "COVID vaccines are safe. Three phases of clinical trials mean the vaccines meet the highest standard of safety and effectiveness."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The statement is consistent with the scientific consensus that COVID-19 vaccines have undergone rigorous testing and have been shown to be safe and effective in preventing severe illness and death from COVID-19. The three phases of clinical trials are a standard process for evaluating the safety and efficacy of any new medication or vaccine.
The text in the image appears to be a quote attributed to Naseeruddin Shah, an actor, regarding the farmers' protest in India. The quote seems to be a statement of opinion or observation about the situation, and it does not contain anything that goes against common sense. It is a statement about the film industry's response to the protest, suggesting that the industry is not as supportive or vocal as it could be. The text is clear and does not contain any contradictory or nonsensical statements.
The text in the image states: "S protein f. 19 Feb 20. 25mM NaPi. pH 7.5 0.3mL/kg/h. 116 PBS, ph 7.5 0.3mL/kg/h."  This text appears to be a description of a solution used in a medical or scientific context, likely related to the coronavirus. It mentions the concentration of sodium phosphate (NaPi) and the pH of the solution, as well as the volume of the solution per kilogram per hour.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward description of a solution that is likely used in the context of medical research or treatment.
The text provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It accurately describes the scene at the crash site of Ethiopian Airlines flight ET, which resulted in the loss of all on board. The image shows a group of people standing near the wreckage, which is consistent with what one would expect to see at the site of a plane crash. The presence of emergency personnel and the condition of the aircraft suggest that this is a serious and tragic event.
The text in the image appears to be a sensationalized headline or description, which is not consistent with the image provided. The image shows a satellite view of a rooftop with various structures, but there is no indication of a plane crash or any other unusual event. The text seems to be unrelated to the image, as it mentions a plane crash near Karachi Airport, which is not visible in the image. This kind of sensationalism is often used to attract attention and may not accurately reflect the content of the image.
The image shows a man speaking into a microphone, and there is no visible text in the image that would provide information about the content of the news or any potential contradictions to common sense.

The text you provided appears to be a statement made by a political figure, which is consistent with the context of the image. The statement seems to be a political commentary rather than a factual statement. It is a common practice for politicians to make such statements during speeches or press conferences.  The statement itself is a critique of the opposing party's political strategy, suggesting that the Democrats are prioritizing obstruction over the nomination process. This is a typical partisan statement, and while it may not be factually incorrect, it is subjective and reflects the speaker's political perspective.  Without additional context, it's difficult to determine if there's anything in the text that goes against common sense. However, the statement is likely to be interpreted differently by different individuals based on their political views.
The text in the image reads "JNU's Pankaj Mishra on FAKE NEWS' IMPACT." The text is a headline or a title for a discussion or article. It does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward statement about a topic.

The text does not contain any information that would be considered contrary to common sense.
The text in the image reads: "Modi Govt approves separate Passport and Flag for Nagaland."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a factual statement indicating that the government of India has approved the creation of a separate passport and flag for the state of Nagaland. This is a significant development for the state, as it will allow for the recognition of Nagaland's unique identity and heritage.
The text provided does not seem to go against common sense. It appears to be a factual statement about the Queen's actions following the death of Prince Philip. The statement is consistent with what one would expect to hear about the Queen's response to the passing of her husband.
The text you provided seems to be a statement attributed to former US President Bill Clinton, suggesting that he believes terrorism and Russia are not significant threats to America. However, it is important to note that this statement is attributed to "private speeches," which means it may not reflect his official stance or policies while in office.  Whether or not this statement aligns with common sense is subjective and depends on one's perspective on global security and geopolitical issues. Some might argue that terrorism and Russia have posed threats to America, while others might disagree.  It's also worth noting that the statement is not directly related to the image of the man wearing a military-style hat. The image does not provide any context or information about the man's identity or the circumstances under which the photo was taken.
The text in the image appears to be a call to action for a national strike in Colombia, which is a form of protest and civil disobedience. The text is in Spanish and reads:  "21 de noviembre / 12/2019 Vamos al paro nacional Contra la política neoliberal, organización y movilización popular"  This translates to:  "November 21 / 12/2019 Let's go to the national strike Against neoliberal politics, organization, and popular mobilization"  The text is consistent with the common sense understanding of a call to protest against certain political policies and to organize and mobilize people to express their dissent. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a caption for an image. It states:  "Train travelling towards Rovenky through Dovzhansk  OSCE UAV films large cargo train in occupied eastern Ukraine.  Dowzhansk (non-government controlled)  17 July 2019  Long-range UAV imagery"  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It describes a situation where a large cargo train is moving through an area that is not under government control, which is a factual observation. The presence of the OSCE UAV suggests that the organization is monitoring the situation, which is a common practice in conflict zones to ensure compliance with international law and to maintain peace and security. The date and location are also provided, which are standard elements in news reporting.
The text in the image appears to be a quote from Kamala Harris, which reads: "Dear Lord, be good to me. The sea is wide and my boat is small." This quote is a well-known saying and does not go against common sense. It is a humble and introspective prayer that has been attributed to Harris and is often used to express a desire for guidance or protection.
The text in the image appears to be a statement about a plane crash in Karachi, Pakistan. However, there is a grammatical error in the text that goes against common sense. The phrase "One of the key reasons why migraines are so stigmatized" is out of context and does not relate to the topic of a plane crash. This suggests that the text may have been mistakenly included or that the image is a screenshot from a video that discusses migraines, but the context of the plane crash is not provided.
The text you provided appears to be a news headline, and it seems to be a legitimate news story. However, without more context or information about the source of the news, it's difficult to determine if there's anything in the text that goes against common sense.  The headline mentions a minor girl being gangraped in Rajasthan's Tonk, which is a serious and sensitive issue. If the headline is accurate and the story is well-sourced, it would be expected to be taken seriously.  If there's something specific in the text that you believe goes against common sense, please provide more details or clarify what aspect you're referring to.
The text in the image appears to be a screenshot from a video that is being shared as evidence of a real plane crash involving PIA (Pakistan International Airlines). However, the text itself contains several elements that go against common sense:  1. The text claims that the plane crash was caused by "images of plane before landing." This is an absurd and nonsensical explanation for a plane crash, as images of a plane before landing would not cause the plane to crash.  2. The text also contains a series of emojis, which are not relevant to the topic of a plane crash and do not provide any useful information.  3. The text includes a phone number, which is not appropriate to share in a context related to a plane crash, as it could potentially be used for malicious purposes.  4. The text mentions "PIA Aircraft Pk-8303," which is a specific model of aircraft, but it does not provide any context or information about the incident that would allow one to verify the authenticity of the claim.  Given these points, it is clear that the text is not a credible source of information about a real plane crash involving PIA. It is likely that the image is being shared as part of a hoax or misinformation campaign.
The text in the image appears to be a statement attributed to Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia. It reads: "Russian and Syrian militaries have defeated the most battle-hardened grouping of international terrorists."  The statement is not inherently against common sense. It is a claim that the Russian and Syrian militaries have successfully defeated a group of international terrorists, which is a common goal in military operations. However, the accuracy of this statement would depend on the specific context and the evidence supporting it.  It's important to note that the text is a quote and should be evaluated in the context of the situation it refers to. Without additional information, it's not possible to determine if the statement is accurate or not.
The text provided in the image appears to be a statement about a person's arrest during a protest. However, there is a discrepancy in the text that goes against common sense. The text states, "In July of , he was arrested for leading a protest peaceful into the Capitol to fight for HEALTH CARE He was arrested while singing prayers!"  The discrepancy lies in the fact that the Capitol is a highly secure area, and it is not possible to enter it peacefully without going through strict security checks. The Capitol is a symbol of the United States government and is not open to the public for entry without proper authorization. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that someone could peacefully enter the Capitol to protest, especially for a cause like healthcare, which is not directly related to the Capitol's function.  Additionally, the statement about being arrested while singing prayers is not consistent with typical protest activities. Protests often involve speeches, chants, or other forms of expression, but singing prayers is not a common form of protest activity.  In summary, the text contains an inconsistency that goes against common sense, as it describes an event that is not logically possible according to the known security measures of the Capitol.
The text you provided appears to be a fictional or humorous statement attributed to Donald Trump, which is not a real quote. It is not based on any known statements made by Donald Trump. The text is likely meant to be satirical or humorous, as it attributes a nonsensical and absurd statement to a public figure.  The statement "tRump You know the floors of the forest, very important" is nonsensical because it does not make sense in the context of a forest or any other real-world scenario. It is not a statement that would be made by a serious or responsible individual, especially in a context where people are discussing a serious issue like a forest fire.  The statement is also not based on any known facts or events. It is not a statement that would be made by a responsible official or expert in a situation where a forest fire is occurring.  Therefore, the text does not go against common sense because it is not a real statement made by a public figure. It is a fictional or humorous creation meant to be amusing or satirical.
The image you've provided appears to be a graph from a scientific paper or report, titled "Figure 5: Variations in population IFR across geographical locations." The graph shows the age-specific infection fatality rate (IFR) for different countries, with the x-axis representing age and the y-axis representing the IFR.  The text in the image is not entirely clear, but it seems to be discussing the variations in the IFR across different places. The statement you've provided is consistent with the information presented in the graph. It suggests that the age breakdown of people infected with COVID-19 can explain the variations in the IFR across different places.  This statement is consistent with common sense, as it is well-established that older individuals are at a higher risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19. Therefore, the age breakdown of those infected can indeed explain the variations in the IFR across different places.  The text in the image also mentions that all rights are reserved, which is standard for academic or professional publications. The percentages next to the countries indicate the proportion of the population that is infected with COVID-19, which is relevant to the IFR as it affects the overall number of cases and deaths.  Overall, the text and the graph in the image are consistent with each other and with common sense understandings of the impact of age on COVID-19 mortality
The text "Tens of thousands evacuate as eyewitnesses report lava, ash and rare volcanic lightning coming from the eruption." is consistent with common sense and what one would expect to hear during a volcanic eruption. The presence of lava, ash, and lightning are all typical phenomena associated with volcanic eruptions. The evacuation of tens of thousands of people is also a reasonable response to such an event, as it would pose significant risks to public safety.
The text in the image appears to be a statement about the relationship between the United States and the Islamic State (ISIS). It suggests that the US is involved in a cover-up, allowing ISIS to escape from Abu Kamal to Syria-Iraq border.  The statement is quite sensational and seems to be making an accusation without providing any concrete evidence to support it. It is not based on common sense or factual information, as it is a subjective interpretation of an image that does not provide clear evidence of the US being involved in such activities.  The image itself is a grainy, low-resolution photograph that does not provide enough detail to discern any specific activities or to confirm the presence of ISIS combat units. It is not possible to draw any definitive conclusions about the situation depicted in the image based on this single photograph.  In general, making accusations without providing evidence is not a responsible or factual approach to understanding complex geopolitical situations. It is important to rely on credible sources and to avoid spreading unsubstantiated claims.
The text in the image discusses the use of DC vaccines, which are a type of cancer vaccine. It mentions that multiple clinical trials have now been conducted using DC vaccines, targeting various cancer types, such as metastatic prostate cancer, melanoma, and others. The text also mentions that these vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective in treating cancer.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The text is discussing the use of a medical treatment, which is a common sense approach to treating cancer. It is important to note that while the text mentions that the FDA has not yet approved these vaccines, this is a common process for new medical treatments, as they must go through rigorous testing and approval processes before they can be made available to the public.
The image shows a group of people, including a man in a red shirt, attending to a group of children who appear to be in distress or possibly deceased. The text in the image is in Arabic, and without a translation, it's not possible to provide specific details about the context or the message conveyed by the text.  The statement "Israel must be proud" is not related to the image and seems to be an unrelated comment. It is not based on any information provided by the image or the text within it. The statement is not logical or factual, as it does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support the claim that Israel should be proud.  The image itself depicts a tragic situation, and it is not appropriate to make light of such a situation or to use it as a platform for political commentary. The focus should be on the well-being of the children and the efforts to provide assistance and care.
The image shows a syringe with a label that reads "Vaccine," indicating that it contains a COVID-19 vaccine. The text "Coronavirus COVID-19" is visible in the background, suggesting that the image is related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The text "Two COVID vaccine stories I filed the day before amp" is not clear enough to read in detail. However, if the text is referring to two separate stories about COVID-19 vaccines, it is not unusual for a journalist to file multiple stories on a topic, especially if there are significant developments or updates.  Without more context or a clearer view of the text, it's difficult to determine if there's anything in the text that goes against common sense. If the text is indeed referring to two stories, it's likely that the journalist is providing information about the COVID-19 vaccines, which is consistent with common sense and the current global health situation.
The text in the image appears to be a screenshot from a social media platform, possibly a news article or a post from a news organization. It discusses the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and the location of the Vikram Lander on the lunar surface.  The text mentions that the Vikram Lander has been located by an Orbitter, which is a spacecraft that orbits a planet or moon. The Orbitter is said to have clicked a thermal image of the Lander.  The statement "Fingers crossed" is a colloquial expression that suggests hope or anticipation for a successful outcome. It is not a factual statement but rather an emotional one.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It seems to be a straightforward report of a space exploration event. However, it is important to note that the reliability of the information in the text would depend on the credibility of the source and the accuracy of the information provided.
The text in the image appears to be a mix of English and Hindi, and it seems to be discussing the new Indian currency notes. However, without a clear understanding of the context or the specific content of the text, it's difficult to determine if there's anything in the text that goes against common sense.  The images show various denominations of Indian currency notes, including a 20 Rupee coin, which is a legitimate form of currency in India. The text mentions "One Rupee note," which could refer to a 1 Rupee note, but without more context, it's unclear what the text is specifically referring to.  If the text is discussing the introduction of a new 1 Rupee note, there's nothing inherently against common sense in that context. However, if the text is discussing something else, such as a new denomination or a change in the design of the notes, it would be important to consider the specific content of the text to determine if it goes against common sense.
The image you've provided appears to be an educational graphic explaining how mRNA COVID-19 vaccines work. The text and images seem to be accurate and consistent with the scientific understanding of mRNA vaccines. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense, as it is providing information about the scientific process of how these vaccines are designed to work.  The graphic explains that mRNA vaccines work by delivering a piece of genetic material (mRNA) to the body, which instructs cells to produce a specific protein. This protein is a part of the virus, and the immune system recognizes it as foreign and mounts an immune response. The text also mentions that the mRNA is encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) to protect it from being broken down by the body and to help it enter cells.  The graphic is informative and does not contain any information that contradicts established scientific knowledge or common sense. It is a clear and concise explanation of the mRNA vaccine technology.
The text "Woman, , becomes oldest new mum in the world after giving birth to twins" is a headline that seems to be a contradiction in terms. The age of the woman is not specified, but the fact that she is described as the "oldest new mum" suggests that she is older than the average age of first-time mothers. However, the fact that she is giving birth to twins is not necessarily unusual, as women of all ages can have twins.  The pictures provided show a woman sitting with two babies, and there is a third picture of a baby lying in a hospital bed with medical equipment around. The text "according to the pictures and news text" implies that the information is based on the visual content and a news report, but without additional context, it's not clear how the age of the woman or the circumstances of her pregnancy were verified.  The statement "according to the pictures and news text" is a common phrase used to indicate that the information is based on the visual content and a news report, but without additional context, it's not clear how the age of the woman or the circumstances of her pregnancy were verified.
The text you provided appears to be a news headline or a statement from a former military official. It mentions a sensational claim about the number of Chinese soldiers killed in a conflict with India.  The statement "More than Chinese soldiers were killed in the dreadful conflict between Indian and Chinese soldiers, in the night of th June" is not inherently against common sense. However, without additional context or evidence, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of this claim.  It is important to approach such statements with a critical eye, as they may be sensationalized or exaggerated for various reasons, such as to garner attention or to support a particular narrative. It is always advisable to cross-check such claims with credible sources and to consider the potential biases or motivations behind the information being presented.
The text in the image appears to be a statement made by a public figure, which is attributed to a news source. The statement is about the alleged suppression of news related to an investigation involving a political figure.  The statement "Trump falsely claims Twitter, Facebook and Google buried Clinton investigation news" is a factual claim that can be evaluated based on the evidence provided. It is not inherently against common sense, as it is a statement about an event that is subject to scrutiny and verification.  However, the statement is a subject of debate and controversy, as it involves political and media issues that are complex and can be interpreted in various ways. The truthfulness of the statement would depend on the specific context and evidence surrounding the alleged suppression of news.  It is important to note that the statement is not a direct observation of the image itself, which shows a person walking past a building with graffiti. The image does not provide any information that would directly support or refute the statement.
The image shows a person washing their hands with soap and water, which is a common practice for maintaining good hygiene. The news text accompanying the image suggests that this practice is effective in the war against COVID-19.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), handwashing with soap and water is one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other viruses. The soap and water break down the protective layer of the virus, making it less effective at infecting others.  The text in the image does not go against common sense. It is consistent with the recommendations of health organizations like the CDC, which emphasize the importance of handwashing in preventing the spread of COVID-19.
The text "Breaking news Taraba state flyover collapsed The flyover say e no do again" appears to be a play on words, suggesting that the flyover has collapsed and is unable to be repaired or used again. However, the phrase "flyover say e no do again" is nonsensical and does not make sense in the context of a flyover collapse. It seems to be a typographical error or a creative way of expressing the situation, but it does not convey a clear message.  The rest of the text seems to be a straightforward report of a flyover collapse in Taraba state. The image shows a group of people standing near the collapsed structure, which is consistent with the news report. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense; it is a typical news report with a minor error in the phrasing.
The text you provided seems to be a mix of information and speculation. The statement "The good news is India has spotted it's Vikram lander on the Moon using the Chandrayaan orbiter However, no signal has been detected yet." is not necessarily against common sense. It is a factual statement that the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) has reported that the Vikram lander is visible on the lunar surface, but no signal has been received from it.  However, the following sentence "The bad news is that the Vikram lander is not on the Moon, it is on the Earth" is against common sense. The Vikram lander is not on Earth; it is on the Moon. This statement is incorrect and contradicts the previous sentence.
The image shows a large group of people wearing white attire, which is often associated with religious gatherings, particularly in South Asia. The text in the image is in Hindi and appears to be a caption or a description of the event.  The text mentions that the event took place in POK, which is a term that refers to the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (POK). The text also mentions that the event was a year old, which suggests that the image is not depicting a recent event.  The claim that the image is of Muslims burning a Pakistani flag is not supported by the text in the image. The text does not mention anything about Muslims or a Pakistani flag. It simply describes the event as taking place in POK.  The image itself does not provide enough context to determine the nature of the event or the identity of the people in the photo. It is important to verify the accuracy of such claims through reliable sources before sharing them.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a statement, but it is not clear enough to read the specific content. If you can provide the text or a clearer image, I can help you determine if there is anything in it that goes against common sense.
The text in the image suggests that the Shree Ram Temple in Ayodhya is a significant architectural achievement and that it should be considered for inclusion in the Wonders of the World. However, it is important to note that the image itself is a digital rendering or a photograph of a model, not an actual photograph of the completed temple. Therefore, the text is not describing an existing structure but rather a proposed or conceptual one.  The statement "Once constructed, Shree Ram Temple in Ayodhya must be India's official entry for Wonders of the World" is a subjective opinion and not a factual statement. It is not uncommon for people to have differing opinions about what constitutes a wonder of the world, and the inclusion of a new site would require a formal process of evaluation by the relevant international bodies.  The text does not go against common sense in the sense of presenting an unrealistic or impossible scenario. It is a statement of aspiration or hope for the future, reflecting the significance of the temple in the context of Indian culture and history.
The text in the image appears to be a statement attributed to President Trump, suggesting that he blames former President Obama for the Russian annexation of Crimea. However, this statement goes against common sense and historical facts.  The annexation of Crimea by Russia occurred in 2014, after the ousting of Ukraine's pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. The annexation was widely condemned by the international community, including the United States under President Obama. The United States, along with the European Union and other countries, imposed economic sanctions on Russia in response to the annexation.  Therefore, it is not accurate to say that President Obama "lost Crimea" to Russia, as the annexation was a unilateral action taken by Russia and not a result of any failure or loss on the part of the United States or President Obama. The statement in the image is a misrepresentation of the historical events and is likely intended to be misleading or to provoke a reaction.
The text you provided seems to be a statement about the presence of "Khalistani" flags and symbols in protests in London. However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine if there's anything in the text that goes against common sense. The statement appears to be a factual observation about the content of protests. If there's something specific you're questioning, please provide more details.
The text in the image appears to be a description of a proposed new structure for the Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Mandir in Ayodhya. It mentions that the structure will be made of wood and stone, and it includes a drawing of the proposed design. The text also provides information about the size of the structure and the date of the proposed construction.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It seems to be a straightforward announcement or description of a proposed architectural project. The text is clear and provides specific details about the project.
The text in the image appears to be a statement about a protest or demonstration. It mentions that thousands of people have marched from Downing Street to the Indian High Commission to send a message to Mr Modi. The statement seems to be a factual description of an event, and there is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a clear and concise statement about a public gathering and its purpose.
The text in the image appears to be a meme or a humorous statement, and it is not meant to be taken literally. It is a play on words, using the phrase "Trene degil isine bakan okuz arıyoruz!" which translates to "We are not afraid of the bull, we are afraid of the bull's horns!" in Turkish. The phrase is a common saying in Turkish, and it is used to express that one is not afraid of something, but rather the consequences or repercussions of dealing with it.  The image features a cartoon bull with a human-like face, which is a common motif in Turkish humor. The text is not meant to be a serious statement about the Egyptian government or its actions. It is simply a joke or a form of satire, and it does not reflect any real-world situation or events.
The text in the image appears to be a caption or a description of an event, and it does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It mentions a group of people, including a Chief Minister, who are standing in front of a tunnel that has been inaugurated twice. The text also provides the names of some of the individuals present at the event.  The caption seems to be a humorous or sarcastic commentary on the fact that the tunnel has been inaugurated twice, which is an unusual occurrence. However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of the event or the significance of the double inauguration.  The text does not contain any information that would be considered against common sense, such as false or misleading statements. It seems to be a straightforward description of an event.
The image shows a group of people, including a man who appears to be signing a document at a desk. The setting looks like a formal or official event, possibly a signing ceremony or a meeting of some sort. The text "Governing like a dictator?" is a subjective statement and does not provide any specific information that can be verified from the image alone.  Without additional context or information, it's not possible to determine if the man in the image is indeed "governing like a dictator." The term "dictator" is often used in political discourse to describe a leader who is perceived to have excessive power and to rule in an oppressive manner. However, without specific details about the event or the individuals involved, it's not appropriate to make such a judgment based solely on the image.  It's important to approach such statements with caution, as they can be misleading or inaccurate. It's always best to rely on credible sources of information and to avoid making sweeping judgments based on a single image or statement.
The text in the image suggests that the Moscow metro station provides free tickets to passengers who perform sit-ups. This is an unusual and likely inaccurate claim, as it goes against common sense. In reality, metro stations typically do not provide free tickets in exchange for physical activities like sit-ups. The text appears to be a humorous or fictional statement rather than a factual one.
The text in the image is a statement about the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Black Americans and other communities of color. It is a factual statement based on data and research that has been widely reported. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense, as it accurately reflects the known disparities in health outcomes related to COVID-19.
The text provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It appears to be a news headline discussing a response from Florida Governor Rick Scott regarding state cuts for mosquito control. The headline is informative and does not contain any contradictory or illogical statements.
The text in the image appears to be a protest sign written in Burmese script. It reads "လံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလံလ
The text you provided appears to be a statement made by President Trump during a press conference. The statement is about CNN's Chris Cuomo and a politician named Richard Blumenthal. The statement is that President Trump believes Cuomo never asked Blumenthal about Blumenthal's claim of serving in Vietnam.  The statement is not inherently against common sense. It is a statement about an event that took place, which is a common type of statement. However, the accuracy of the statement would depend on the context of the press conference and the specific circumstances surrounding the interaction between Cuomo and Blumenthal.  It's important to note that the truthfulness of the statement would depend on the actual events that occurred, which may not be fully captured in a single sentence. Therefore, to determine if the statement is against common sense, one would need to consider the broader context and the accuracy of the statement.
The text in the image states: "It's a national scandal that black mothers are 3 to 4 times more likely to die in childbirth than white women." This statement is supported by research and is widely recognized as a significant health disparity in the United States. It is not a statement that goes against common sense, as it reflects a well-documented and alarming statistic.
The text in the image appears to be a news article discussing the origins of the COVID-19 virus and the claims that it was created in a Wuhan lab. The text includes statements such as:  - "Chinese virologist claims that the new coronavirus was created in a lab and has proof virus made in Wuhan lab." - "Dr. Li Meng-Yan, a rese archer at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, had previously told the South China Morning Post that the virus was man-made." - "The geopolitical implications of the virus being man-made are enormous."  The text also mentions that the virus was created in a lab and has proof virus made in Wuhan lab.  It is important to note that the claims made in the text are controversial and not widely accepted by the scientific community. The majority of scientific evidence suggests that the COVID-19 virus is a natural, zoonotic virus that originated from animals and was not created in a lab.  The text also includes a statement that "the geopolitical implications of the virus being man-made are enormous," which is a subjective statement and not a fact.  It is also worth noting that the text is from the Daily Mirror, which is a British tabloid newspaper known for its sensationalist headlines and stories. The credibility of the newspaper and the accuracy of
The text "State Department Furiously Denies Promising No Boots on the Ground" is a headline that seems to be a misinterpretation or a sensationalized representation of a situation. It is not a factual statement and does not provide any context or evidence to support the claim.  The phrase "no boots on the ground" is a common idiom used to describe a situation where military personnel are not physically present in a conflict zone. It is not a promise or a commitment, but rather a statement about the current state of affairs.  The State Department, as a government agency, would not make such a promise or commitment, as it is not within their authority to make decisions about military deployments. The State Department is responsible for diplomacy and foreign policy, not military operations.  Therefore, the text does not provide any information that goes against common sense. It is a misleading headline that does not accurately represent the situation it is referring to.
The text in the image appears to be a message of gratitude and support for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. It expresses respect and prayers for doctors in Italy and around the world who are working to protect people and counter the spread of the virus. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a positive and supportive message.
The image you've provided appears to be a chart from a news source, showing the demographic breakdown of voter turnout in a particular election. The chart is divided into four categories: Race, Income, Age, and Party ID. Each category is further broken down into four groups: Rarely or Never Vote, Sometimes Vote, Almost Always Vote, and Almost Always Vote.  The chart includes percentages for each group within each category. For example, in the Race category, 25% of Black voters fall into the "Rarely or Never Vote" group, while 75% fall into the "Sometimes Vote" or "Almost Always Vote" groups.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The chart is a representation of the data collected from the election, and it provides a clear visual representation of the voter turnout rates among different demographic groups. The percentages are based on the actual data from the election, and they reflect the reality of voter participation in the United States.
The text "Muslims raise Pakistani flag in Srinagar, protesting against kashmiripandits amp" seems to be a description of an event. However, the text contains a grammatical error. The word "amp" is not a standard English word and does not fit well in the context of the sentence. It is likely a typographical error or a misinterpretation of the intended word.  The rest of the text appears to be a straightforward description of an event, which is consistent with what can be seen in the image. The image shows a group of people holding flags, with one person prominently holding a flag that appears to be the Pakistani flag. The setting looks like a public gathering or protest, and the presence of the Pakistani flag suggests that the event is related to the political situation in the region, which has been a source of conflict and tension for many years.  Without additional context, it is not possible to determine the accuracy of the text's description of the event. However, the image itself does not provide any information that goes against common sense. It depicts a scene that is consistent with what one might expect in a situation where a group of people is protesting or expressing solidarity with a particular cause or country.
The text in the image appears to be a description of a protest taking place outside an Austin police station. It mentions that there are many people participating in the protest, and it seems to be a peaceful gathering. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense; it is a straightforward description of an event.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a statement from a news source. It reads: "Anderson Cooper 360: 'Fresh dig at seems to distance herself from any involvement.'"  The statement seems to be a commentary on a situation involving Anderson Cooper and someone named "Anderson." The phrase "fresh dig" suggests that the commentary is critical or negative in nature. The phrase "seems to distance herself from any involvement" implies that the person being referred to is trying to distance themselves from something related to Anderson Cooper.  Without additional context, it's difficult to determine if the statement goes against common sense. However, if the statement is accurate and based on factual information, it would be reasonable to assume that it is not going against common sense. If the statement is inaccurate or based on speculation, it could potentially go against common sense.
The text "Face masks could be giving wearers coronavirus immunity, experts suggest" is not consistent with current scientific understanding of COVID-19 and face masks. While face masks can help reduce the transmission of respiratory droplets, which can contain the virus, they are not a substitute for vaccination or other preventive measures. The idea that face masks could provide immunity to COVID-19 is not supported by credible scientific evidence.
The text provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It is a factual statement about an event that occurred, which is the departure of President Trump from the White House and the arrival of President-elect Biden. The text does not contain any information that would be considered unusual or counterintuitive.
The text in the image appears to be a statement from Eric Trump, suggesting that Joe Biden is using a teleprompter during a speech. The statement is not inherently misleading; it is a common observation that politicians often use teleprompters during speeches. However, the implication that this is somehow a negative trait or a sign of inauthenticity is a subjective interpretation and not a factual statement.  The use of a teleprompter does not necessarily indicate that a politician is not speaking from the heart or is not genuine. It is a tool that many speakers use to ensure they deliver their message accurately and without errors. The decision to use a teleprompter is often based on the nature of the speech, the complexity of the topic, and the speaker's personal preference.  In summary, the text itself is not misleading; it is a statement of fact about the use of a teleprompter. However, the interpretation of the use of a teleprompter as a negative trait is subjective and may not align with common sense.
The text provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It describes a tragic event that occurred in Beirut, Lebanon, and provides details about the number of people affected and the extent of the damage. The text is consistent with what one would expect to read in a news report about such an event.
The text provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It describes an event where a drone was successfully destroyed by air defense forces, which is a typical outcome when a drone is intercepted or shot down. The text is consistent with what one would expect to read in a news report about such an event.
The text provided in the image appears to be a news headline or a statement attributed to President Trump. It is not clear from the image alone whether the statement is accurate or not, as it would require additional context to determine its veracity.  The statement "Trump says his administration will start withholding funds from sanctuary cities after court ruling" is a specific action that the administration is reported to be taking. It is not inherently against common sense, as it is a policy decision that is within the purview of the executive branch of the United States government.  However, the effectiveness and legality of such a policy would depend on the specific circumstances and the court ruling in question. It is important to note that the interpretation and application of such a policy could be subject to legal challenges and would likely be the subject of ongoing debate and discussion.
The text in the image appears to be a screenshot from a news broadcast or a social media post. It states, "The FBI Is Investigating The Trump Supporters Who Were Seemingly Driving Out A BidenHarris Campaign Bus."  There is nothing inherently against common sense in this statement. It is a factual report of an ongoing investigation by the FBI. However, it is important to note that the context of the situation and the nature of the investigation are not provided in the image. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the accuracy or the implications of the investigation from the image alone.  It is also worth noting that the image itself is blurry and of low quality, which makes it difficult to read the text clearly. This could potentially lead to misinterpretation or misunderstanding of the text.
The text provided appears to be a description of an event, specifically a plane crash in Karachi, Pakistan. It mentions that the plane is a PIA (Pakistan International Airlines) plane and that it crashed in a residential area. The text seems to be a straightforward description of an incident, and there is nothing in the text that goes against common sense.  However, it's important to note that the image provided is blurry and does not show the plane crash itself. It's also worth noting that the text mentions "CCTV footage," which suggests that there is a video available that shows the event. If the image or the text is intended to be a part of a news report or a social media post, it's crucial to verify the information with reliable sources before sharing it, as misinformation can spread quickly and cause panic or confusion.
The image shows a book titled "If I Ran the Zoo" by Dr. Seuss. The book is known for its whimsical and imaginative content, which often includes fantastical and surreal elements that go against common sense. The story is about a young boy who dreams of running a zoo and imagines various animals in unconventional roles and settings.  The text in the image is not clear enough to provide specific details about the content of the book. However, if you are referring to the book's content, it is important to note that Dr. Seuss's stories are intentionally nonsensical and often defy common sense, which is part of their charm and appeal. The stories are meant to be imaginative and to encourage readers to think creatively and outside the box.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a statement, but it is not clear what the context of the statement is or what "VikramLander" refers to. Without additional information, it is not possible to determine if the statement goes against common sense or not. The text seems to be incomplete and does not provide enough context to make a meaningful assessment.
The image shows a man standing outdoors, smiling at the camera. He appears to be dressed in business attire, suggesting a professional setting. The text "Dr." is present, which could imply that the man is a doctor or has a doctorate in a field.  Without additional context, it's difficult to determine if there's anything in the text that goes against common sense. The text "Dr." is a common title for medical professionals, so it's not unusual to see it in this context. If there's a specific part of the text you're referring to, please provide more details, and I can comment further.
The text provided in the image is a headline that reads: "Pakistan passenger plane with onboard crashes in Karachi moments before landing."  The headline seems to be a sensationalized or inaccurate description of an event. It is not common sense to describe a plane crash as a "crash in moments before landing" because a plane crash is a catastrophic event that typically occurs during takeoff, landing, or while in flight. It is not common for a plane to crash just moments before landing, as the landing process is usually the safest part of a flight.  The headline is likely intended to grab attention, but it does not accurately describe the situation. It is important to rely on credible sources for news and to avoid sensationalized headlines that may not accurately represent the events they describe.
The image you've provided appears to be a screenshot of a television screen displaying election results. The text on the screen indicates that there are new votes coming in from Pennsylvania. The numbers suggest that Joe Biden is leading in the state, with a significant margin over Donald Trump.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The numbers are presented in a clear and straightforward manner, and the context of the image is consistent with what one would expect to see during an election broadcast. The image does not contain any information about PornHub, and there is no indication that PornHub is involved in the election results or that it is being displayed on the screen.
The text you provided does not seem to contain any information that goes against common sense. It appears to be a statement about the impact of COVID-19 and other viral outbreaks on board ships, which is a topic of concern and discussion in the context of maritime health and safety. The statement is likely to be discussing the challenges and measures taken to prevent the spread of such diseases on ships.
The text "Don't mistake this for a river" is a humorous statement, as the image clearly shows a boat on a body of water that is described as a river. The statement is meant to be a playful reminder that the image is not of a different type of water body, such as a lake or a canal, but rather a river. It is not a statement that goes against common sense, as it is a correct description of the image.
The text you provided is a statement made by a person, which is not necessarily a factual statement. It is a political statement that reflects the person's opinion on mail-in voting. The statement is not inherently against common sense, as opinions are subjective and can vary widely among individuals. However, the statement does not provide any evidence or data to support the claim that mail-in voting is "horrible" and "corrupt."  It is important to note that the topic of mail-in voting is a subject of ongoing debate and discussion, with different opinions on its effectiveness, security, and accessibility. Some people argue that mail-in voting can be vulnerable to fraud and abuse, while others argue that it is a safe and convenient way to vote, especially during a pandemic when in-person voting may not be feasible.  In general, the statement does not go against common sense in the sense of defying basic laws of logic or reality. However, it is a statement that reflects a particular political perspective, and as such, it is subject to scrutiny and debate.
The text in the image states, "Secure the Texas Border." Below that, there is a hashtag "#BUILDTHEWALL." The image shows a person standing in front of a border wall, with a cityscape in the background.  The statement "Fact , illegals are in Texas prisons for sexual assault" is not a fact. It is a misleading statement that is not supported by credible sources. The statement is likely intended to be inflammatory and to support the idea of building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to prevent illegal immigration.  It is important to note that the statement is not based on factual evidence and is likely intended to provoke an emotional response rather than to provide accurate information.
The text in the image appears to be a screenshot of a social media post with a caption that seems to be making a claim about the ownership of buildings in Italy by the Gandhi family. However, the text itself does not provide any evidence or context to support this claim. It is not uncommon for social media posts to contain inaccurate or misleading information, and without additional information or a source for the claim, it is not possible to determine the veracity of the statement.  The image shows a man waving at the camera in front of a historic building, which could be a tourist attraction or a significant landmark. The presence of the man and the building in the image does not provide any direct evidence to support the claim about the Gandhi family's ownership.  In general, it is important to approach such claims with skepticism and to verify information from reliable sources before sharing or accepting it as fact.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a promotional statement about a COVID-19 vaccine called COVAXIN.

It is a factual statement about a regulatory approval for a vaccine. The text is clear and does not contain any contradictory or nonsensical information.
The text in the image appears to be in Hindi, and it seems to be discussing a news story about the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and a lunar mission. The text mentions that the ISRO has found a location on the lunar surface, which is a significant achievement for space exploration.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a typical news headline that reports on a scientific discovery or accomplishment. The text is informative and seems to be accurately conveying the information provided by the ISRO.
The text in the image appears to be a weather forecast or a description of a weather event, specifically a typhoon named Molave. It mentions that Molave is on a crash course with central Vietnam, which is a common sense observation based on the image of the typhoon.  The text also includes a temperature reading for Himawardi-8 Band 13 Brightness Temperature (°C) and a note about the Typhoon Molave. The temperature reading is a standard meteorological measurement used to estimate the temperature of the Earth's atmosphere.  The statement "molave looks really impressive for a late October typhoon in S China Sea and is on a crash course with central Vietnam tomorrow" is a subjective observation about the size and intensity of the typhoon, which is a common way to describe weather events.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense, as it is a straightforward description of a weather event and its potential impact on a specific region.
The image you've provided appears to be an infographic summarizing the impact of COVID-19 on global health. It includes statistics on the number of deaths, the number of children at risk, and the number of pregnant women affected by the virus. It also mentions the economic impact of the pandemic.  From the text provided, there doesn't seem to be anything that goes against common sense. The statistics are sourced from reputable organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations (UN). The infographic is designed to convey the severity of the pandemic and its effects on various aspects of global health.  However, it's important to note that while the statistics are likely accurate, they are just a snapshot of the situation at the time the infographic was created. The situation regarding COVID-19 is constantly evolving, and the numbers could have changed since the infographic was published.
The text "State Department Furiously Denies Promising No Boots on the Ground" is a headline that seems to be a misinterpretation or a sensationalized representation of a situation. It is not a factual statement and does not go against common sense.  The headline suggests that the State Department is denying a promise made by the United States government, but without additional context, it is unclear what the actual situation is. It is possible that the headline is referring to a specific event or statement that is not accurately represented in the text.  In general, it is important to be cautious when interpreting headlines and to seek out reliable sources of information to ensure that one's understanding of events is accurate and well-informed.
The text provided in the image appears to be a summary of COVID-19 statistics for Queensland, Australia, as of June 16, 2020.

The image you've provided appears to be a slide from a presentation, summarizing the economic impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) on long-run GDP, long-run capital stock, long-run wage rate, and long-run full-time equivalent jobs. The slide includes percentages that represent the change in each of these areas.  From the information provided, there doesn't seem to be anything that goes against common sense. The slide is presenting data and analysis that are likely to be based on economic models and forecasts. However, it's important to note that the interpretation of such data can be subjective and may vary depending on the source and the assumptions made in the analysis.  It's also worth mentioning that the TCJA has been a topic of much debate and discussion, with opinions on its economic impact ranging widely. Some argue that it has boosted economic growth, while others contend that its benefits have been overstated or that it has contributed to increased income inequality.  The slide itself is a summary of economic projections, and without additional context or information, it's not possible to determine if the data is accurate or if the analysis is sound. It's always advisable to critically evaluate such information and consider multiple sources when forming an opinion on complex economic issues.
The text in the image appears to be a quote attributed to a woman, which seems to be a statement about a political or social issue. The quote suggests that the woman is acknowledging that a certain event or development is not a complete victory but rather a step towards a larger goal. This statement is consistent with common sense and reflects a strategic or incremental approach to achieving a desired outcome.  Without additional context, it's not possible to determine if the quote is accurate or if it's being taken out of context. However, the statement itself does not go against common sense. It's a common way to describe the process of achieving a goal, where each step is important but not the final victory.
The text in the image does not provide any information that goes against common sense. It is a personal update from a woman who has tested positive for COVID-19. The text is straightforward and does not contain any information that would be considered unusual or counterintuitive.

The image shows a person sitting among a large quantity of vegetables, including what appears to be a significant amount of cucumbers. The text in the image is not clear enough to read, so I cannot provide any information about the content of the text.  Regarding the common sense aspect, it's important to note that the image is a photograph and may not represent a typical or common scenario. It could be a staged photo, a moment captured during a harvest, or a scene from a market or farm. Without additional context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of the situation.  If the text in the image is related to the scene, it might provide more information about the context or the person's role in the situation. However, without clear text, it's not possible to make any definitive statements about the content of the text or whether it goes against common sense.
The text in the image is a call to action for people to visit the Government of Canada's webpage for the most up-to-date information on the novel coronavirus. It is a standard public health message encouraging individuals to seek reliable information from official sources. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The message is clear and straightforward, providing a direct link to the relevant information.
The text you provided seems to be a statement about the location of the Vikram Lander on the lunar surface. However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine if there's anything in the text that goes against common sense. The text appears to be a straightforward announcement or update about the lunar lander's location.

The text provided appears to be a factual report of events in Myanmar. It describes the actions taken by the police in response to a large protest against the military coup. The use of tear gas, stun grenades, and live ammunition is consistent with the tactics employed by law enforcement during large-scale protests to disperse crowds and maintain order.

The text in the image is a public health message that emphasizes the importance of taking COVID-19 symptoms seriously, as mild symptoms in one person can potentially lead to severe illness in another. This is a common sense message, as it is well-established that COVID-19 can have a wide range of symptoms, from mild to severe, and that some individuals may be asymptomatic carriers. The message encourages individuals to get tested if they experience any symptoms, which is a responsible and proactive approach to managing the spread of the virus.
The text provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It describes Sudha Murthy, the wife of Narayan Murthy, the co-founder of Infosys, engaging in an act of humility and service by selling vegetables in front of a temple. This action is consistent with the idea of giving back to the community and maintaining a humble attitude, which is a common practice in many cultures.
The text you provided is a statement attributed to Rick Santorum, a former United States Senator and presidential candidate. The statement is: "Climate scientists are driven by the money that they receive."  This statement is often criticized for oversimplifying the issue of climate change and for suggesting that scientists are motivated by financial gain rather than by the pursuit of knowledge and the desire to understand and mitigate the impacts of climate change.  The scientific community generally agrees that climate change is a real and pressing issue that requires urgent attention. The overwhelming majority of climate scientists are not motivated by financial gain but by the desire to understand and solve a complex problem that affects the planet and its inhabitants.  The statement is also considered to be misleading because it implies that climate scientists are the only ones who receive funding for their research. In fact, climate change research is funded by a variety of sources, including governments, non-governmental organizations, and private foundations.  In summary, the statement attributed to Rick Santorum is often criticized for oversimplifying the issue of climate change and for suggesting that scientists are motivated by financial gain rather than by the pursuit of knowledge and the desire to understand and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
The text you've provided seems to be a misinterpretation or a misquote of a statement made by the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO has indeed stated that people without COVID-19 symptoms are unlikely to transmit the virus. However, the statement about people without symptoms rarely transmitting the virus is accurate and in line with common sense.  The WHO has also emphasized that asymptomatic individuals can still spread the virus, especially if they are in close contact with others. Therefore, it is important for everyone, regardless of symptoms, to follow public health guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19.  The text in the image does not go against common sense. It accurately reflects the WHO's stance on the transmission of COVID-19 by asymptomatic individuals.
The image you've provided shows the White House at night, illuminated by its lights. The text you've mentioned is not visible in the image, so I'm unable to comment on its content. If you're asking if there's anything in the text that goes against common sense, I would need to see the text to provide an answer.
The image you've provided appears to be a screenshot of a social media post with a humorous or satirical intent. The text in the image includes a statement that "New York Times printed a crocodile on front page with title India's PM cried." This statement is not factual and goes against common sense.  The New York Times, as a reputable news organization, would not print a crocodile on its front page. The image of a crocodile is not a photograph of a front page of the New York Times, and the text is likely meant to be a joke or a commentary on the media rather than a literal description of an event.  The presence of a crocodile in the image is not a typical sight in a newsroom or on the front page of a newspaper, which is why the statement is absurd and not something that would happen in reality.
The text in the image appears to be a screenshot from a news broadcast, and it seems to be reporting on an incident where a cable provider, RCN, accidentally broadcasted minutes of hardcore pornography live on CNN, specifically to its Boston customers. The text does not contain anything that goes against common sense; it is a straightforward report of an unusual and potentially inappropriate event.
The image you've provided appears to be a sculpture or a piece of art that is designed to look like a tree with human figures integrated into it. The text you've provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It seems to be a straightforward description of the artwork. If there is something specific you are referring to that you believe goes against common sense, please provide more context or clarify what you are referring to.
The text in the image discusses the potential risks of carbon dioxide toxicity, which can occur when wearing a face mask for an extended period. It mentions that carbon dioxide toxicity can cause symptoms such as dizziness, confusion, headache, and unconsciousness. The text also provides information on the volume of air inhaled and the percentage of carbon dioxide that can be harmful.  The text does not go against common sense in terms of the risks of carbon dioxide toxicity. It is a fact that wearing a face mask can increase the concentration of carbon dioxide inhaled air, especially if the mask is tight-fitting or the wearer is engaged in physical activity. It is important to be aware of these risks and to take breaks or remove the mask if symptoms of carbon dioxide toxicity occur.  However, it is worth noting that the risks of carbon dioxide toxicity are generally low when wearing a face mask, especially when it is properly fitted and the wearer is not engaged in strenuous activity. The text does not provide information on the likelihood of these symptoms occurring, which is important for context and understanding the risks.
The image you've provided is of an animated character, not a real person. The character is depicted as a sloth wearing a green shirt and sitting at a desk with a tablet in front of it. The text "this guy counting the ballots in Nevada" is a humorous and fictional scenario, as it attributes human-like actions to an animated character.  In reality, ballot counting is a serious and often time-consuming process carried out by election officials, not by a single individual. The text is likely meant to be a joke or a playful commentary on the process of counting ballots, rather than a literal description of events.
The text provided does not seem to go against common sense. It appears to be a statement about the mindset of India and Pakistan in relation to a cricket match, suggesting that their preparation and focus remain unchanged despite the high-stakes nature of the match. This is a common sentiment in sports, where athletes often emphasize the importance of maintaining their usual routines and mindset to perform at their best.

The image also includes a logo for the Welsh Government, which suggests that the information is official and reliable.
The text in the image states, "Total federal government employees since 1939." It shows a graph with a line that appears to be declining over time. The text below the graph reads, "There are spikes every 10 years because of employees hired to conduct the US Census."  The statement "Trumps press secretary said the federal workforce has seen a dramatic expansion" is not consistent with the information presented in the graph. The graph itself shows a decline in the number of federal employees over time, which contradicts the idea of a dramatic expansion. The text below the graph explains that there are spikes in the number of employees every 10 years due to the US Census, which is a temporary increase in employment.  Therefore, the statement made by Trump's press secretary is not supported by the information presented in the graph. It is important to critically evaluate statements made by press secretaries and to verify them with credible sources.
The text in the image appears to be a protest sign that reads "Freiheit für uns Mut und Gemüt." This translates to "Freedom for us Courage and Good Mood." The sign is expressing a desire for freedom and a positive attitude, which is a common sentiment among protesters.  The text does not contain anything that goes against common sense. It is a statement of personal preference and a call for freedom, which is a fundamental human right. The sign does not make any claims that are factually incorrect or contradict common sense.  However, it is important to note that the context of the protest and the specific reasons for the protest are not provided in the image. It is always advisable to consider multiple sources of information when evaluating the validity and implications of a protest or any public statement.
The text in the image reads: "Farmers protesting at the DelhiGhazipur border DelhiUP march towards Delhi."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It accurately describes a situation where farmers are protesting at the Delhi-Ghazipur border, which is a location on the outskirts of Delhi, and they are marching towards Delhi. The text is clear and informative, providing a concise description of the event.
The text in the image appears to be a meme or a piece of satire, rather than a factual statement. It is making a comparison between the actions of a company (Reliance) and the behavior of a person (shamelessness). The text is not providing factual information but is using exaggerated language and imagery to create a humorous or critical effect.  The text states: "Oxygen Donated by Saudi Arabia and Rebelled by India And Reliance is trying to take the credit by applying stickers of Reliance on it."  This statement is not factual and is likely meant to be a joke or a commentary on corporate behavior. It is not a statement of fact and should not be taken as such.
The text provided does not seem to go against common sense. It appears to be a statement from an analyst or expert on the situation between India and China, suggesting that while there is an escalation on the border, a broader armed conflict is unlikely. This statement is consistent with the idea that while tensions may be high, both countries may be trying to avoid a larger conflict.
The text in the image appears to be a headline from a news source, which seems to be discussing the situation in Kashmir. The headline states, "Our children are in jail: How India is keeping Kashmir isolated and in fear."  The statement "Kashmir is under the siege of brutal Indian forces after stripping Kashmir's nominal autonomy by Modi's fascist government" is a subjective interpretation of the situation and is likely to be a point of contention. It is a political statement that may not be universally accepted as factual.  The rest of the text seems to be a summary of the situation, which is generally acknowledged to be a complex and long-standing conflict with historical, political, and social dimensions. The text does not contain anything that goes against common sense in the context of the situation it is describing.  However, it is important to note that the interpretation of such events can vary widely, and the headline is likely to reflect the perspective of the news source or the author of the headline.
The text in the image suggests that patients waiting for elective surgery should receive COVID-19 vaccines ahead of the general population. This recommendation is based on a study that potentially links postoperative deaths to COVID-19.  The text does not go against common sense in the context of public health and medical advice. It is generally accepted that vaccinations can help prevent the spread of infectious diseases and reduce the risk of severe illness and death. In the context of elective surgery, where patients are often older and have underlying health conditions, the risk of complications from COVID-19 can be higher. Therefore, it makes sense to prioritize vaccinations for this group to help protect them from the virus.  However, it's important to note that the text is a summary of a study, and the actual study would provide more detailed information about the research methodology, findings, and implications. It's also worth noting that the effectiveness of vaccines can vary depending on the specific vaccine, the timing of the vaccine, and the individual's health status.
The text "20 km" in the image suggests that the area shown in the satellite image is 20 kilometers in length. However, without additional context, it's not clear what the "20 km" refers to. It could be the length of the flooded area, the length of the river, or the length of the road or path that has been flooded. Without more information, it's difficult to determine if this statement goes against common sense.
The image you've provided appears to be a meme or a piece of satire rather than a legitimate news report. The text in the meme is exaggerated and humorous, which is typical of internet memes. It's not a serious news report.  The text in the meme is making a joke about the wealth of a farmer protest leader, suggesting that he is protesting against the rich while being rich himself. This is a play on the irony of the situation, which is often used in satire to critique hypocrisy or contradictions.  The meme is not a reliable source of information and should not be taken as a factual representation of the situation. It's important to verify information from credible news sources before sharing or relying on it.
The text you provided is a statement attributed to Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf. The statement "The most dangerous place in America is Donald Trump's mouth" is a subjective opinion and does not necessarily go against common sense. It is a political statement expressing a viewpoint about the actions and words of a public figure. Whether or not one agrees with the statement, it is not inherently contrary to common sense.
The image you've provided shows the White House at night, illuminated by its lights. The text you've included is a humorous take on a press release, suggesting that the White House is copying paragraphs from ExxonMobil's press releases. This is a playful commentary on the perceived similarity in the language and style of press releases from different organizations.  The text itself does not contain anything that goes against common sense. It is a fictional scenario created for comedic effect. The statement "White House appears to copy paragraph from ExxonMobil press release" is a joke, implying that the White House is using the same language as ExxonMobil, which is a common practice in corporate communications.  However, it's important to note that the image and the text are not related to each other. The image shows the White House, while the text is a humorous commentary on the style of press releases.
The text in the image appears to be a statement about a protest, suggesting that it is not only about farmer bills but also about the food we eat. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It seems to be a clear and straightforward statement about the context of a protest.
The text in the image appears to be a headline or a title of a video or article, and it seems to be discussing a topic related to religious conversion in India. The text mentions "Jesus Gandhi" and "Holy Bible," which are not actual entities but rather concepts or symbols. The phrase "How to convert India into Christian nation?" is a provocative statement that could be interpreted as promoting religious conversion or advocating for a specific religious ideology.  Whether the text goes against common sense depends on the context in which it is presented and the intentions of the person or entity who created it. If the text is part of a legitimate news source or educational material, it might be presenting an objective view of the topic. However, if it is part of a biased or misleading source, it could be promoting an agenda or spreading misinformation.  It's important to approach such topics with a critical eye and to seek out reliable sources of information to form an informed opinion.
The text provided in the image seems to be a news headline, and it does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It describes a scene where several parts of Ayodhya are illuminated, which is a common practice during special events or celebrations. The headline also mentions that the foundation stone laying ceremony of Ram Temple is about to take place, which is a significant event in Hinduism.  The image shows a nighttime view of a river with lights reflecting on the water, and there are buildings and structures along the riverbank. The lighting and the presence of people suggest that this is indeed a special occasion.  Therefore, the text and the image together provide a coherent and factual representation of an event that is likely to be of interest to many people.
The text in the image appears to be a statement about a police officer named Derek Chauvin, who was involved in the death of George Floyd. The statement suggests that Chauvin is a racist and that he should have been removed from the police force earlier.  The text does not contain anything that goes against common sense. It is a statement of opinion about a public figure and an event that has been widely reported and discussed. The statement is based on the information available at the time the image was taken and does not contain any factual inaccuracies.
The text "JUST IN Trump hits Merkel in tweet demanding more money from Germany for NATO" is a headline that summarizes a news story. It is not a statement of fact but rather a description of an event. The headline is based on the content of a tweet by former US President Donald Trump, which is a public statement.  The headline does not go against common sense in the sense that it is a factual statement about an event. However, it is important to note that the content of the tweet itself may be subject to interpretation and analysis, and the context of the tweet, including the tone and the implications, may be open to different perspectives.  In general, the headline is a straightforward summary of a news event, and it does not contain any information that is inherently contrary to common sense.
The image you've provided appears to show a group of individuals dressed in protective suits, which suggests that they are either medical professionals or individuals involved in a response to a biological hazard. The text "CV Library VT''s Investigation into a biowarfare pandemic" is not visible in the image, so I cannot comment on the accuracy or content of the text.  However, I can comment on the image itself. The image is in black and white, which is not typical for modern photography, suggesting it might be an older photo or intentionally stylized to evoke a certain mood or atmosphere. The individuals are wearing full-body protective suits, which is a standard practice in situations where there is a risk of exposure to hazardous materials or infectious diseases.  Without more context or information about the situation depicted in the image, it's difficult to determine if there's anything in the image that goes against common sense. The image itself seems to be a realistic representation of a situation where individuals are taking precautions to protect themselves from a potential biological hazard.
The text you provided seems to be a statement about the Dominion Voting System, which is a type of electronic voting machine. The statement suggests that the machine has the physical ability to mark votes onto the ballot after the last time the voter sees the ballot.  This statement goes against common sense because it implies that the voting machine could be manipulated to change votes without the voter's knowledge or consent. In a fair and transparent voting system, it is crucial that the voter's choice is accurately recorded and not altered after the voter has made their selection.  The statement is likely referring to the Dominion Voting System's ability to perform a recount or audit of the votes, which is a standard feature in many voting systems. However, the way the statement is phrased could be misleading, as it does not specify that the machine is only capable of marking votes after a recount or audit, and not during the actual voting process.  It is important to note that the Dominion Voting System has been the subject of controversy and allegations of fraud in the 2020 United States presidential election. However, numerous audits and recounts have found no evidence of widespread voter fraud or manipulation of the Dominion Voting System.
The text you provided seems to be a commentary on a situation that is not depicted in the image. The image shows a large group of people, possibly in a protest or a gathering, with some individuals running or walking away from the main group. There is no clear indication of violence or a peaceful riot in the image.  The text you provided appears to be a statement about a situation that is not directly related to the image. It seems to be a commentary on a larger political or social issue, which may or may not be related to the image. However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine the accuracy or relevance of the text to the image.  It's important to note that the image itself does not provide enough information to make a definitive statement about the nature of the event or the intentions of the individuals involved.
The text in the image reads: "INTRO:PERSONA COVIDUS amp"  The statement "COVIDUS amp" is not a complete sentence and does not convey a clear message. It appears to be a fragment of a sentence or a phrase that is not fully explained or contextualized within the image. Without additional information, it's difficult to determine if the statement is accurate or if it goes against common sense.  However, the phrase "COVIDUS amp" could be interpreted in various ways, and without further context, it's not possible to provide a definitive answer. It's important to consider the source of the information and the context in which it is presented to determine if it is accurate or not.
The image shows a person receiving a COVID-19 vaccination, and the text "COVID vaccines are working in the real world" is consistent with the common sense understanding that vaccines are effective in preventing the spread of the virus in the real world. This is supported by scientific evidence and public health data.
The image shows a group of people, including a man who appears to be Xi Jinping, the President of China, holding what looks like a cluster of cells or a microscopic view of a virus. The text overlay on the image includes the words "TRUMP*" and "WORLD," which seem to be unrelated to the content of the image.  The text "TRUMP*" is likely a reference to former U.S. President Donald Trump, but without additional context, it's unclear what the asterisk signifies. The word "WORLD" is also unclear in its context, as it doesn't seem to be related to the image or the text "TRUMP*."  The image itself does not provide any information about the spread of the coronavirus. It appears to be a staged photo, possibly for a political or satirical purpose, rather than a depiction of a scientific or medical event.  The text "rare footage of xi Jinping, How does the corona virus spread" is a misleading statement, as the image does not show Xi Jinping discussing the spread of the coronavirus, nor does it provide any scientific information about the virus. The text seems to be a play on words, suggesting that the image is rare footage of Xi Jinping, but it does not provide any valuable information about the coronavirus.
The image shows a person holding a package of hydroxychloroquine, which has been mentioned in the context of COVID-19 treatment. The text "Hydroxychloroquine for COVID Cureall or flimflam?" suggests a discussion about the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19.  Without additional context, it's difficult to determine if the text goes against common sense. However, it's important to note that hydroxychloroquine has been the subject of much debate and controversy due to conflicting reports on its efficacy for treating COVID-19. Some studies have suggested potential benefits, while others have found no significant impact on patient outcomes.  Given the ongoing research and the evolving understanding of COVID-19, it's crucial to rely on credible sources of information and to follow the guidance of healthcare professionals when it comes to the treatment of COVID-19.
The text you provided does not seem to go against common sense. It appears to be a statement from Rudolph Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City, regarding his role in a proposed statement on corruption in Ukraine. The statement suggests that Giuliani is not the main author of the statement and that he is not directly involved in the proposed statement. This is consistent with the idea that he is playing down his role in the matter.
The image shows a person swimming in a body of water, possibly a lake or a pond, with a backdrop of sand dunes, which suggests a desert-like environment. The text "Escaping from the corona virus like photo" is a playful and humorous comparison, suggesting that the person in the water is "escaping" from the coronavirus pandemic in the same way that the image of the water body might be seen as an escape from the virus.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a creative and light-hearted way to express a desire to escape the challenges and restrictions imposed by the pandemic. The image itself is a normal depiction of a person enjoying a swim in a natural setting.
The text in the image appears to be a statement of solidarity with the students and colleagues at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in India. It expresses support for their demands for quality education and the right to freedom of expression. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The statement is clear and seems to be a reasonable expression of support for the rights of students and academics to express their views and receive an education that meets their needs.
The text in the image appears to be a news article discussing the death of a farmer who has been protesting outside a DC office. The article mentions that the farmer has been protesting for a while, and it seems to be a significant event, as the farmer's death is being reported in the media.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The article is reporting a tragic event and providing context about the farmer's protest. It is a typical news article that would be expected to follow standard journalistic practices.
The text in the image states, "Inflation fell to 2.4% in April 2018." This is good news because inflation is typically considered a measure of the overall health of an economy. When inflation is low, it means that the purchasing power of money is relatively stable, which can be beneficial for consumers and businesses.  The graph in the image shows a downward trend in inflation over the past few months, which is consistent with the text. The graph is labeled with "Consumer Price Index (CPI)" and "Inflation target," indicating that the data is related to the cost of living for consumers and the target set by the central bank for inflation.  There is nothing in the text or the graph that goes against common sense. The information presented is consistent with what one would expect to see in a report on inflation rates.
The text "Like a proud parent, Perseverance Mars rover snaps a selfie with Ingenuity drone" is a creative and anthropomorphic description of the image. It is not a literal statement but rather a metaphorical one. The image shows the Perseverance Mars rover and the Ingenuity drone on the Martian surface, and the rover is indeed taking a picture of itself with the drone in the background. This is a common practice in space exploration to document the progress and activities of the rover and other equipment on the Martian surface. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense; it is a playful and imaginative way to describe the image.
The text provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It is a factual statement about the flags being flown at halfstaff in honor of Nancy Reagan.
The text you provided appears to be a fabricated or misleading statement. It suggests that Rosie ODonnell, a well-known American comedian and television personality, offered to give GOP senators millions of dollars in exchange for voting against a tax bill. This statement is not consistent with any known public statements or actions by Rosie ODonnell.  It is important to verify the accuracy of news and information before sharing or relying on it. The statement seems to be a form of satire or a fictional scenario created for comedic or illustrative purposes, rather than a real event.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a statement from a news source. It reads: "Six people have tested positive for the coronavirus in New South Wales during the hour period to pm last night."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense.

The statement is clear and does not contain any information that would be considered contrary to common sense.
The text you provided is a statement made by Rick Santorum, a former United States Senator and presidential candidate. The statement "Climate scientists are driven by the money that they receive" is a controversial and debatable claim.  On one hand, it is true that climate scientists often receive funding from various sources, including government agencies, private foundations, and academic institutions. This funding is typically used to support research and studies on climate change.  On the other hand, the implication that the money received by climate scientists somehow influences their research findings is a common misconception. Scientists are expected to follow the scientific method and report their findings objectively, regardless of the source of their funding. The scientific community has strict guidelines and standards to ensure that research is conducted ethically and without bias.  In summary, while it is true that climate scientists receive funding, the claim that this funding influences their research findings is not supported by the scientific community and is considered to be a misconception.
The text in the image states: "The COVID-19 vaccine has undergone rigorous tests, including clinical trials, that are globally recognised as having the highest safety standards."  This statement is generally accurate and aligns with common sense. The development of COVID-19 vaccines has involved extensive clinical trials to ensure their safety and efficacy. These trials are designed to test the safety and effectiveness of a vaccine in a large population, and they are conducted according to strict regulatory standards. The fact that multiple COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized for use by various health authorities around the world is a testament to the rigorous testing process they have undergone.  Therefore, the text in the image does not go against common sense. It accurately reflects the scientific and regulatory processes that have been followed to ensure the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines.
The text in the image states, "WATCH A viral video showing the Pornhub logo appearing during CNN's live coverage of the US elections is FALSE." This statement is factual and aligns with common sense. It is not common for the Pornhub logo to appear during live news broadcasts, especially during significant events like US elections. The image appears to be a screenshot from a social media platform, and the text is a clarification that the video in question is not authentic.
The image shows a rhino grazing on grass. The text "Breaking! according to the pictures and news text, Is there anything in the text that goes against common sense?" is not providing any specific information or context that would allow me to determine if there is anything in the text that goes against common sense. The text appears to be a placeholder or a generic statement that does not provide any relevant information. If you have a specific question or context regarding the text, please provide more details so I can assist you better.
The text you provided is a statement about Mike Pence's political stance. It is not a factual statement about the woman in the picture. The statement is a matter of opinion and interpretation of Pence's actions and policies. It is not a factual statement that goes against common sense.
The image shows a wall with various medical devices and equipment, including a blood pressure monitor, a stethoscope, and a pulse oximeter. There is no news text visible in the image to provide information about insurers pulling out of Obamacare.  Regarding your question about insurers pulling out of Obamacare, it's important to note that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare, has faced challenges and changes over the years. Some insurers have indeed left the ACA marketplaces, citing financial losses and the need to adjust their business models. However, it's also worth noting that the ACA has helped to reduce the number of uninsured Americans and has provided essential health benefits to millions of people.  As for the news text, without seeing it, I can't comment on whether it contains anything that goes against common sense. News text should be factual and based on reliable sources, but it's always important to critically evaluate news sources and their credibility.
The image you've provided appears to be a political cartoon rather than a photograph of a real event. It depicts a stylized representation of a political rally, with a large wave labeled "Modi Wave" crashing down on a ship labeled "TMC" (Trinamool Congress), which is a political party in India. The cartoon is likely meant to be humorous or satirical, commenting on the political situation in West Bengal, where the TMC is a major party.  The text in the image reads: "Wave of Bengal! PM Modi's mega rally at Bengal's Brigade ground." This suggests that the cartoon is commenting on a political rally held by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in West Bengal, which is a state in India.  The cartoon does not provide specific information about the number of people present at the rally. However, it is common for political rallies to attract large crowds, so it is reasonable to assume that there were many people present.  The text in the image does not contain anything that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward description of a political event.
The text in the image appears to be a meme or a humorous statement rather than a factual one. It says, "Hey Anti-Vaxxers, This is what life is like when we don't have a vaccine for a very contagious disease. Do you understand yet?"  The statement is not factual because it is not based on evidence or data. It is a hypothetical scenario that is not currently the case. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the development and distribution of vaccines, which have been shown to be effective in preventing severe illness and death from the virus. The text is likely intended to be satirical or to provoke thought about the importance of vaccines in controlling the spread of infectious diseases.  However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of vaccines is a matter of scientific consensus and not a matter of personal opinion or belief. Vaccines are developed through rigorous scientific testing and are considered to be one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
The text "Israel Hits Beirut with Nuclear Missile, Trump and Lebanese Govt." is not consistent with common sense or known facts. Nuclear missiles are not used in conventional military conflicts, and the use of such weapons would have catastrophic consequences. Additionally, the text does not provide any credible sources or evidence to support the claim that Israel has used a nuclear missile against Beirut. The image shows a large explosion, but without further context, it is not possible to determine the cause of the explosion or the accuracy of the text.
The text in the image does not provide any information about Trump implying Putin used the N-word when talking about Obama. The text only mentions that Trump and Obama are shown side by side in the image. The statement about Trump implying Putin used the N-word is not supported by the text in the image.
The image you've provided appears to show a man in a suit, possibly a politician or a public figure, looking to the side with a serious expression. The text "Alex Wong/Getty Images" indicates that the image is from Getty Images, a well-known source of photography.  The text "Fact Check of the Day President Trump repeated his claim that James Clapper admitted to campaign spying." is a statement that seems to be a factual observation. It does not contain anything that goes against common sense.  However, it's important to note that the statement about President Trump's claim regarding James Clapper is a separate issue from the image itself. The image does not provide any information about the veracity of the claim made by the President. It's a photograph of a person, and the text is a commentary on a political statement.
The text in the image appears to be a headline from a news source, which seems to be reporting on a statement made by Representative Maxine Waters. The headline suggests that Waters is endorsing the accuracy of the Trump-Russia dossier, which contains allegations of sexual activities.  The statement "Sex Actions" is a part of the dossier, which is a compilation of unverified information about President Donald Trump's alleged ties to Russia. The dossier was compiled by a former British intelligence officer and contains a variety of allegations, some of which are related to sexual activities.  The headline is likely intended to be sensational and to draw attention to the dossier and Waters' comments. However, it's important to note that the dossier has not been independently verified, and its contents are not considered to be proven facts.  The headline does not go against common sense in the sense that it is a statement made by a public figure, but it does rely on the assumption that the allegations in the dossier are true, which is not a common sense understanding of the situation. It's also worth noting that the dossier has been the subject of much controversy and has been widely discredited due to the lack of evidence to support its claims.
The text in the image appears to be a label or tag on a package, and it does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It seems to be a standard label with various pieces of information, including a barcode, a tracking number, and some text that likely pertains to the package's origin, destination, or other logistical details.  The news text at the bottom of the image is not clearly visible, so I cannot comment on its content. If you have a specific question about the news text or if there's something in the image that you're curious about, please let me know, and I'll do my best to assist you.

The text in the image appears to be a headline or a statement about an event. It reads: "Chitral: Clash over forced conversion of Kalash girl."  The headline seems to be a factual statement about an incident that took place in Chitral, which is a region in Pakistan. The text suggests that there was a conflict or confrontation involving a Kalash girl, which is a minority ethnic group in the region. The term "forced conversion" implies that the girl may have been coerced into converting to another religion, which is a serious allegation.  Without additional context, it's difficult to determine if there's anything in the text that goes against common sense. However, the headline does seem to be a straightforward description of an event, and it doesn't contain any obviously false or misleading information. It's important to note that the accuracy of the headline would depend on the credibility of the source and the accuracy of the reporting.
The image contains a series of statements in Hindi, which appear to be related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Indian government's response to it. The text includes quotes attributed to various individuals, some of which are likely to be misleading or inaccurate. Here are the statements and their translations:  1. "Jawaharlal Nehru's government did not allow the entry of Chinese people in India."    - This statement is not accurate. While there were restrictions on the entry of Chinese citizens during the India-China War of 1962, there is no evidence to suggest that the Indian government did not allow the entry of Chinese people in general.  2.

The text in the image suggests that Tom Hanks, who was in quarantine at the Gold Coast Hospital, was kept company by a roll-in volleyball.

The cartoon is likely meant to be humorous or satirical, commenting on the political situation in West Bengal, where the TMC is a major party.  The text in the image reads: "Wave of Bengal! PM Modi's mega rally at Bengal's Brigade ground." This suggests that the cartoon is commenting on a political rally held by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in West Bengal, which is a state in India.

The text on the document is in Bengali, and it mentions the dates for the first phase of voting, which is April 1 to May 19, 2021.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The document is from a reputable source, the ECI, and it provides accurate information about the election dates. The text is clear and the document is structured in a way that is typical for official election announcements.  The image also includes a red stamp with the word "FAKE" across it, which is likely added to indicate that the document is not authentic or has been altered. This is a common practice on social media to warn users about potential misinformation.  The presence of the "PIB FactCheck" logo suggests that the image is being shared as part of a fact-checking initiative to verify the authenticity of the document.
The text you provided appears to be a statement about an event that took place in Delhi. It is a serious allegation that the Delhi Police were involved in throwing stones at Muslim properties and assisting a Hindu extremist mob.  The statement is not inherently against common sense, as it is a description of an event that has been reported in various media outlets. However, the accuracy of the statement would depend on the credibility of the source and the evidence supporting the allegations.  It is important to note that such allegations can have serious implications and should be treated with caution. It is crucial to verify the information through reliable sources before drawing conclusions or making judgments based on such statements.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline, which reads: "Farmers protesting at the DelhiGhazipur border DelhiUP march towards Delhi."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward statement describing an event that is taking place. The headline is informative and does not contain any contradictory or nonsensical information.
The text in the image appears to be a screenshot of a social media post with a caption that reads "Picture from farmers protests in delhi." There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The image shows a person in a mask handing out what appears to be food to others, which is a common and compassionate act during times of need or protest. The context of the image suggests that it is depicting a moment from a protest event, which is a legitimate form of expression and assembly in many countries.
The image you've provided shows three different individuals, each with a distinct expression and attire. The text "Antifa stands for antifascist" is a statement that is generally accepted as true. Antifa is a political movement that opposes fascist ideologies and actively works to prevent the spread of fascist groups.  The text itself does not go against common sense. It is a clear and accurate statement about the meaning of the term "Antifa." If there is something in the text that you believe goes against common sense, please provide more context or clarify what you are referring to.
The text in the image appears to be a statement made by President Donald Trump during a press conference. The statement is about his stance on Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. The text itself does not go against common sense; it is a statement of Trump's position on the matter. However, the context of the statement and the implications of siding with Putin over the FBI on this issue are subjects of ongoing debate and discussion.
The text you provided seems to be discussing the risks associated with conducting a COVID-19 test, specifically a nasopharyngeal swab test, which involves inserting a swab into the cavity between the nose and throat to collect a sample for testing.  The text mentions the "brain blood barrier," which is a protective barrier that separates the brain from the bloodstream. It suggests that there is a risk of damaging this barrier when conducting a COVID-19 test.  However, it is important to note that the brain blood barrier is a highly specialized and robust structure that is not easily penetrated. It is designed to protect the brain from harmful substances and pathogens in the bloodstream.  While it is possible for a nasopharyngeal swab to come into contact with the brain blood barrier during a COVID-19 test, the risk of damaging this barrier is extremely low. The swab is inserted into the nasopharynx, which is the upper part of the throat that leads to the nose and sinuses, and not directly into the brain.  Therefore, the statement in the text that suggests there is a risk of damaging the brain blood barrier when conducting a COVID-19 test by inserting a swab into the nasopharynx is not accurate and goes against common sense.
The text you provided appears to be a statement about a legal issue related to the appointment of John Yoo to the position of Attorney General. The statement suggests that Yoo's appointment violates the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which requires that certain high-ranking government officials, including the Attorney General, be appointed with the advice and consent of the Senate.  The statement is based on the premise that Yoo is serving in an acting capacity, but has not undergone Senate confirmation. This is a common sense interpretation of the Appointments Clause, as it is generally understood that the clause applies to both formal and acting appointments.  Therefore, the text does not go against common sense. It is a statement of legal analysis based on the text of the Constitution and the circumstances of Yoo's appointment.
The text you've provided appears to be a statement about the situation of Muslims in India, mentioning various incidents of violence and discrimination. However, the text is not factually accurate and is likely to be biased or misleading. It is important to approach such statements with a critical eye and to verify information from multiple sources before accepting it as fact.  The statement "INDIA IS BLEEDING with the BLOOD OF MUSLIMS" is an exaggeration and does not reflect the actual situation in India. While there have been incidents of violence and discrimination against Muslims in India, it is not accurate to say that the entire country is "bleeding" with their blood.  The statement "Delhi Riots were given a free hand" is also not factually accurate. The 2020 Delhi riots were a series of violent clashes between Hindus and Muslims in Delhi, India, which resulted in the death of at least 53 people. The situation was complex and involved a range of factors, including political tensions and communal violence. It is not accurate to say that the Delhi riots were given a "free hand" by the government.  The statement "Pregnant Mothers were torn" is not supported by credible evidence and is likely to be an exaggeration or a misrepresentation of an event.  The statement "Mosques Burnt Houses Demolished"
The text "Vaccines can protect us from many of the most serious illnesses" is a statement that is generally accepted as true within the context of public health and medical science. It is a widely recognized fact that vaccines play a crucial role in preventing the spread of infectious diseases and reducing the severity of illnesses.  Therefore, there is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. Vaccines are a proven and effective method of protecting individuals and communities from a variety of diseases.
The text in the image suggests that a Cuban antiviral medicine, Recombinant Interferon Alpha B (IFNrec), is being used against coronavirus in China and Venezuela as an immune system booster. While the use of interferon as a treatment for viral infections is not uncommon, the specific claim that this medicine is being used against coronavirus in China and Venezuela is not widely reported or confirmed by reputable sources.  The text does not provide any evidence or references to support the claim that this medicine is being used in these countries. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the accuracy of this statement based on the information provided in the image. It is important to verify such claims with reliable sources before accepting them as fact.
The text "CCTV video shows PIA plane crashing into Karachi building" is not consistent with the image provided. The image shows a person standing behind a glass barrier, not a scene of a plane crashing into a building. The text appears to be a misinterpretation or a fabrication, as there is no evidence in the image to support the claim made in the text.
The text in the image appears to be in Hindi and is discussing a political issue, specifically related to Rahul Gandhi, a prominent Indian politician. The text mentions that Rahul Gandhi is not married to a Colombian woman, which is a factual statement.

The text is discussing a political matter, and the statement about Rahul Gandhi's marital status is accurate.
The text in the image appears to be a screenshot of a social media post that is making a claim about the dates of legislative assembly elections. The claim is that the Election Commission of India (ECI) has not yet declared the dates for the elections.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The text is clear and straightforward, stating that the ECI has not yet declared the dates for the elections. This is a factual statement that can be verified by checking the official website or news sources for updates on the election dates.  The image also includes a stamp that reads "FAKE," which indicates that the information is not accurate or has been fabricated. This is a common practice on social media to warn users about misinformation.  The presence of the "FAKE" stamp suggests that the post is intended to inform users that the information about the election dates is not reliable and should not be taken as accurate.

The text in the image appears to be a transcription of a conversation or interview, but without additional context, it's difficult to determine if there's anything in the text that goes against common sense. The text seems to be a normal conversation, discussing topics such as the 49ers, the NFL, and the person's personal experiences.  If you're referring to something specific in the text that you believe goes against common sense, please provide more details or clarify what aspect you're questioning.
The text provided in the image seems to be a description of a protest event. It mentions an antimilitary regime protest, which is a common form of political expression. The text does not contain anything that goes against common sense. It describes a peaceful demonstration with people from different ethnicities marching together, which is a typical scenario for a protest. The text also mentions the specific location and day of the event, which is consistent with how such events are reported in the media.
The text you provided seems to be a description of a technology or concept rather than a statement of fact. It mentions "shapeshifting Army robots" and "configurations they need to accomplish the mission," which are not currently possible with existing technology.  However, the text does not necessarily go against common sense. It is a speculative statement about the potential future capabilities of robots, which is a common topic in discussions about robotics and artificial intelligence. It is not a statement of fact about the current state of technology.  It's important to note that while the text is speculative, it is not inherently against common sense. It is a statement about the potential future developments in robotics and technology, which is a legitimate area of discussion and research.
The text in the image states, "Lunch in Denmark," which is a factual statement. It does not provide any information about the context or the circumstances surrounding the image. The image itself shows a person eating a meal, but without additional context, it is not possible to determine if the person is eating luxuriously or if the children in the background are poor or starving.  The claim that the image shows eating luxuriously in front of poor and starving children is not supported by the image or the text. It is a subjective interpretation of the image that goes beyond the factual information presented.  It is important to note that images and news text can be easily misinterpreted or taken out of context, and it is always advisable to verify information from multiple sources before drawing conclusions.
The image shows a person sitting amidst a large quantity of vegetables, including what appears to be a significant amount of cucumbers.

If there is a specific detail in the image that you believe goes against common sense, please provide more information or clarify what aspect you are referring to.
The image appears to be an infographic summarizing the Mars 2020 mission by NASA, which includes the Perseverance rover. The text and images provide information about the mission, the rover's capabilities, and the challenges faced in the search for evidence of past life on Mars.  From the text and images, there is nothing that goes against common sense.

It provides a clear explanation of the mission's objectives and the challenges involved in exploring Mars.  The text and images are consistent with what we know about space exploration and the scientific methods used to search for signs of past life on other planets. The information presented is based on scientific research and the capabilities of the technology used in the mission.
The text you provided is a sensational and misleading headline. It is not supported by any credible news sources or evidence. The idea of a pregnant elephant being fed pineapple filled with explosives is not only absurd but also impossible, as it defies the laws of physics and biology.  The headline is likely a hoax or a piece of satire designed to shock or entertain, rather than to inform. It is important to be skeptical of such headlines and to verify information from credible sources before sharing or believing it.
The text in the image is a statement by Robert Reich, a well-known economist and former U.S. Secretary of Labor, explaining the process of impeachment. It is a straightforward explanation of the steps involved in impeaching a president. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The image appears to be a thumbnail for a video or an article, and the text is clear and informative.
The text in the image appears to be a meme or a piece of satire, and it is not a factual statement. It is not common sense to suggest that the FBI would give a terrorist the okay for weapons, as the FBI's primary mission is to protect the United States from terrorism and other criminal activities. The FBI is responsible for investigating and preventing acts of terrorism, and they do not issue permits or approvals for individuals to possess weapons. The text is likely intended to be humorous or to make a political statement, but it does not reflect reality.
The image shows a person wearing a blindfold and seemingly trying to navigate through a doorway. The text on the image reads, "We're doomed." This statement is not based on any factual information and appears to be a humorous or exaggerated commentary on the situation. It does not go against common sense, as it is a playful observation rather than a statement of fact.
The text "HurricaneDorian was still blasting the northwestern Bahamas Monda." is consistent with the image, which shows a house surrounded by water, indicating that the area has been affected by a hurricane. The presence of the house in the water suggests that the storm surge from the hurricane has caused significant flooding in the area. The image and the text together provide a clear depiction of the aftermath of a hurricane in the Bahamas.
The text you provided seems to be discussing the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Wuhan Institute of Virology. It mentions the Chinese government's refusal to allow independent journalists or investigators into Wuhan and the theory that the coronavirus leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  The statement "The Chinese government's refusal to allow independent journalists or investigators into Wuhan, coupled with evidence that the coronavirus passed through but didn't start in the Wuhan market, fuels the theory it leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology." is a logical conclusion based on the information provided. It suggests a causal relationship between the Chinese government's actions and the theory about the virus's origin.  However, it's important to note that the theory about the coronavirus originating from the Wuhan Institute of Virology is still a subject of scientific debate and investigation. While there is evidence that the virus was present in Wuhan before the first reported cases, the exact source of the virus is not yet conclusively determined.  The text does not contain anything that goes against common sense. It presents a coherent argument based on the information available at the time the text was written.
The text in the image states: "Trump falsely claims Twitter, Facebook and Google buried Clinton investigation news."  This statement is not in line with common sense. It is a factual claim that can be verified or refuted. The statement implies that there was an investigation into Hillary Clinton, and that Twitter, Facebook, and Google deliberately suppressed or buried news about this investigation.  However, this claim is not supported by credible evidence. There is no widely accepted evidence that these companies engaged in a coordinated effort to bury news about the Clinton investigation. In fact, many news outlets, including those on social media platforms, reported extensively on the investigation.  Therefore, the statement in the image is not consistent with common sense and is likely to be misleading or false.
The text in the image reads: "At Mandalay, Myanmar citizens are protesting for democracy and justice."  There is nothing in this text that goes against common sense. It accurately describes a situation where people are gathering to express their political views and advocate for democratic principles and justice. The text is clear and concise, and it accurately reflects the content of the image.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a summary of a news story. It reads: "STUDY: U.S. importers, not China, paying for most tariffs."  The statement "STUDY: U.S. importers, not China, paying for most tariffs" is a factual statement based on the information provided. It suggests that a study has found that the costs of tariffs are being borne by U.S. importers rather than by China. This is a common sense interpretation of the statement, as tariffs are taxes imposed on imports, and the burden of these taxes would typically fall on the importers rather than the exporters.  The rest of the text in the image seems to be a typical news headline, providing context for the study and its implications. It mentions that the study was conducted by CNN, and it includes a time stamp indicating when the news segment was broadcast.  Without additional context, it's not possible to determine if there's anything else in the text that goes against common sense. The statement about tariffs is consistent with economic principles and is a straightforward interpretation of the information presented.
The text you provided is a statement attributed to Rick Santorum, a former United States Senator and presidential candidate. The statement is: "Climate scientists are driven by the money that they receive."  This statement is often criticized for oversimplifying the issue of climate change and for suggesting that scientists are motivated by financial gain rather than by the pursuit of knowledge and the desire to understand and mitigate the impacts of climate change.  The scientific community generally agrees that climate change is a real and pressing issue that requires urgent attention. The overwhelming majority of climate scientists are not motivated by financial gain but by the desire to understand and solve a complex problem that affects the planet and its inhabitants.  The statement is also considered to be misleading because it implies that climate scientists are the only ones who receive funding for their research. In fact, climate change research is funded by a variety of sources, including governments, non-governmental organizations, and private foundations.  In summary, the statement attributed to Rick Santorum is often criticized for oversimplifying the issue of climate change and for suggesting that scientists are motivated by financial gain rather than by the pursuit of knowledge and the desire to understand and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
The text in the image appears to be a headline or a statement about the coronavirus, which is a real and ongoing global health concern. The text seems to be factual and does not go against common sense. It mentions that the coronavirus has spread to multiple countries beyond China and provides a death toll and a reference to the UK.  The images accompanying the text show various animals, including a pig, a chicken, and a bat, which are not directly related to the coronavirus. The image of the bat is particularly interesting because bats are known to be a natural reservoir for many zoonotic viruses, including coronaviruses. However, the image does not provide any information about the specific strain of the coronavirus that is currently causing the pandemic, which is SARS-CoV-2.  The text does not provide any information that would contradict common sense or established scientific knowledge about the transmission and origin of the coronavirus. It is important to note that the coronavirus is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets and close contact with infected individuals, and there is no evidence to suggest that it is transmitted through animals or their products.
The text in the image appears to be a description of a COVID-19 RT-qPCR test kit. It mentions that the kit is "ICMR approved" and has "sensitivity and specificity to detect Covid virus."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It seems to be a straightforward description of a product that is intended for use in detecting the COVID-19 virus. The text does not contain any information that would be considered unusual or counterintuitive.
The text in the image appears to be a mix of English and Hindi, and it seems to be discussing the new Indian currency notes. However, without a clear understanding of the context or the specific content of the text, it's difficult to determine if there's anything in the text that goes against common sense.  The images show various denominations of Indian currency notes, including a 20 Rupee coin, which is a legitimate form of currency in India. The text mentions "One Rupee note," which could refer to a 1 Rupee note, but without more context, it's unclear what the text is specifically referring to.  If the text is discussing the introduction of a new 1 Rupee note, there's nothing inherently against common sense in that context. However, if the text is discussing something else, such as a new denomination or a change in the design of the notes, it would be important to consider the specific content of the text to determine if it goes against common sense.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a caption, but it is not fully visible. The visible part of the text reads "So far, B." This does not provide enough context to determine if it goes against common sense or not. The rest of the text is cut off and not visible in the image. If you can provide the full text or more context, I could attempt to analyze it further.
The text in the image is accurate and reflects the historical significance of Kamala Harris's election as Vice President of the United States. She is the first woman, the first Black American, and the first Asian American to hold this position.
The text in the image appears to be in Hindi, and it seems to be reporting an event where a man jumped from a building into floodwater to rescue a teenager. The text does not contain anything that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward description of an event that is likely to be considered heroic or selfless.  However, it is important to note that jumping from a building into floodwater is a dangerous act and should not be encouraged or replicated without proper safety measures. It is always advisable to seek safer alternatives when attempting to rescue someone in a hazardous situation.
The text in the image appears to be a tweet from a user named Ashoke Pandit, who is commenting on a situation involving a bus driver and passengers. The tweet seems to be a response to an incident where a bus driver is accused of being involved in a crime. The text mentions that the driver is being held at ransom by sword-wielding tyrsts, which is an exaggerated and sensationalized description of the situation.  The tweet also includes a hashtag that seems to be unrelated to the incident being described, which is "#GretasOfD." This hashtag is likely referencing a different topic or event, which is not directly related to the bus driver or the passengers.  The text does not provide any factual information that goes against common sense. However, the use of hyperbolic language and the inclusion of unrelated hashtags might be seen as sensationalizing or misleading, which could be considered against common sense in terms of responsible reporting or commentary.
The text in the image states, "COVID is a new disease, caused by a novel or new coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans." This statement is factually accurate. COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is indeed a new disease that emerged in late 2019 and has not previously been seen in humans. It is a novel coronavirus, meaning it is a new strain of the coronavirus family that has not been identified before.
The text provided in the image appears to be a statement about an event that occurred in Wisconsin. It suggests that "violent leftist radicals" burned down a church, despite the presence of a "Black lives matter" sign.  The statement is likely to be controversial and may be seen as inflammatory or inaccurate by some. It is important to note that the text is a single sentence and does not provide any context or evidence to support the claims made. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from the text alone whether the statement is factually accurate or not.  In general, it is important to approach such statements with caution and to seek out reliable sources of information to verify the accuracy of any claims made.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline, which reads: "PM Narendra Modi himself is conducting so many rallies in Bihar."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a factual statement that the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, has been conducting rallies in the state of Bihar. This is a typical activity for a political leader during an election campaign or during a visit to a state.
The text provided in the image appears to be a statement about a protest event. It mentions that a protest took place in Delhi on the occasion of Congress Foundation Day, with participants carrying Indian flags and marching in favor of farmers. The text also mentions that the protest was against the Modi government and its policies.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a clear and concise description of an event that took place, with the participants expressing their views and concerns. The text does not contain any information that would be considered illogical or contrary to common sense.
The image shows a person holding a Confederate flag, which is often associated with symbols of the Confederate States of America (CSA) during the American Civil War. The CSA was a group of 11 Southern states that seceded from the United States and fought against the Union in the Civil War. The flag is a symbol of the CSA and has been controversial due to its association with slavery, racism, and the Civil War.  The text "January , ." is not clear enough to provide any context or information that would go against common sense. It appears to be a fragment of text, possibly a date or a sentence, but without additional context, it's difficult to determine its relevance to the image or the situation depicted.
The image you've provided appears to be a COVID-19 daily report for North Dakota, dated Tuesday, July 28, 2020. It includes various statistics related to COVID-19 in the state, such as the number of active cases, daily new positive test results, and total unique individuals tested.  From the information provided, there doesn't seem to be anything in the text that goes against common sense. The numbers are presented in a clear and straightforward manner, and the context of the report is consistent with what one would expect from a public health report.  However, it's important to note that the interpretation of such data can be subjective, and different individuals may have different perspectives on the significance of the numbers presented. For example, some might focus on the number of active cases, while others might be more concerned about the number of daily new positive test results or the total number of individuals tested.  Additionally, the image includes a disclaimer at the bottom that says, "For active case trend data and other detailed information, please visit our COVID-19 Dashboard at health.nd.gov/covid19dashboard." This suggests that the report is meant to provide a snapshot of the situation and that more detailed information can be found on the state's COVID-19 dashboard.  Overall, the text in the image seems to be a straightforward presentation of COVID-19 statistics
The image shows a person, presumably a pharmacist or a healthcare worker, reaching for a medication in a pharmacy or a medical storage area. The text in the image does not provide any information about South Africa joining a COVID clinical trial. The text is not related to the image and does not provide any context or information that would be relevant to the image.  The text "Solidarity Why South Africa is joining the worlds first COVID clinical trial" is not present in the image. The text "Solidarity Why South Africa is joining the worlds first COVID clinical trial" is a separate statement that does not correspond to the image provided.  Therefore, there is no information in the image or the text that goes against common sense. The image and the text are unrelated, and the text does not provide any information that can be verified or assessed for accuracy.
The text provided in the image seems to be a news headline or a statement about a political situation. It mentions that MPs in Moscow are furious about the renaming of an area outside the Russian embassy in Washington to Boris Nemtsov Plaza, after the murdered Kremlin critic.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a factual statement about a political event and the reaction of some individuals to it. The text is clear and does not contain any information that would be considered contrary to common sense.
The text in the image appears to be a headline or a summary of a news story. It mentions that two men have been arrested at a Starbucks and have agreed to participate in a program for young entrepreneurs as part of a settlement with the city of Philadelphia.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward statement of an event and the outcome of a legal settlement. The text does not contain any information that would be considered unusual or counterintuitive.
The text you provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It appears to be a straightforward news report stating that Kim Jong-un has reportedly died after a heart surgery. The text is consistent with what one would expect from a news source reporting on a significant event.
The text provided in the image states: "IDF published footage of an airstrike against a building they say was an alQassam Brigades intelligence headquarters."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward statement about an airstrike and the building that was targeted. The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) is known for its military operations, and it is not unusual for them to publish footage of their operations. The alQassam Brigades is a militant group associated with Hamas, a Palestinian organization that has been involved in conflict with Israel. The intelligence headquarters of such a group would be a legitimate military target.  The image itself shows a blurry aerial view of a building, which could be the building in question. However, without more context or a clearer image, it is not possible to confirm the identity of the building or the accuracy of the IDF's statement.
The text in the image appears to be a tweet from a Twitter account that is not verified. The tweet states, "I would not sign Graham-Cassidy if it did not include coverage of pre-existing conditions. It does! A great Bill. Replace & Replace."  The statement "It does!" is likely referring to the Graham-Cassidy bill, which was a proposal to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. The bill was controversial and faced intense criticism from both sides of the political aisle.  The claim that the bill includes coverage for pre-existing conditions is not accurate. The Graham-Cassidy bill would have allowed states to opt out of certain provisions of the ACA, including the requirement to cover pre-existing conditions. This would have potentially left millions of people with pre-existing conditions without access to affordable health insurance.  Therefore, the text in the image is not consistent with common sense and is misleading. It is important to verify information from reliable sources and not rely on unverified tweets for accurate information.
The image shows a large group of people wearing white attire, which is often associated with religious gatherings, particularly in South Asia. The text in the image is in Hindi and appears to be a caption or a description of the event.  The text mentions that the event took place in POK, which is a term used to refer to the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (POK). The caption also mentions that the event was a year old, which suggests that the image is not depicting a recent event.  The claim that the image is of Muslims burning a Pakistani flag is not supported by the visual content of the image. The attire of the people and the setting do not suggest a violent or anti-Pakistan sentiment. The text does not provide any evidence to support the claim that the event involved burning a Pakistani flag.  The caption also mentions that the event was a year old, which would make it difficult to claim that it is a recent event.  In summary, the image does not depict a recent event, and the claim that it shows Muslims burning a Pakistani flag is not supported by the visual content of the image. The text in the image does not provide any evidence to support this claim.
The text "Muslims raise Pakistani flag in Srinagar, protesting against amp" seems to be a misinterpretation or a typographical error. The text is likely meant to say "Muslims raise Pakistani flag in Srinagar, protesting against amendment," which would make more sense in the context of the image.  In the image, there is a group of people holding flags, and it appears to be a protest or a demonstration. However, without more context, it's not possible to determine the exact nature of the protest or the specific issues being addressed. The text provided does not align with the visual content of the image, which shows a group of people with flags, but it does not provide enough information to determine the specific circumstances or the identities of the individuals involved.
The text in the image appears to be a statement about the recognition of Juan Guaidó as the legitimate leader of Venezuela by the United States and other countries. The statement is consistent with the political situation in Venezuela, where Guaidó has declared himself the interim president and has been recognized as such by several countries, including the United States.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense, as it accurately reflects the international response to the political crisis in Venezuela. The statement is based on the fact that the United States and other countries have recognized Guaidó as the legitimate leader, which is a position that has been widely reported in the media and is consistent with the actions of these governments.
The text in the image states, "Fully Vaccinated People Are Still Wearing Masks Then You Without Vaccination." This statement is not accurate and goes against common sense.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that fully vaccinated individuals can resume activities without wearing a mask in most settings, except for certain situations such as in healthcare settings, on public transportation, or in areas with high transmission rates. The CDC's guidance is based on scientific evidence that shows that vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe illness and death from COVID-19.  Therefore, the statement in the image is misleading and does not reflect the current guidance from public health authorities. It is important to follow the recommendations of health organizations like the CDC to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a caption that describes an event.

This is a typical activity for a political leader during an election campaign or during a visit to a state.
The image shows a Halloween decoration with skeleton heads, and there is a bowl of candy placed on a table. The text "Video altered to make it look like Biden greeted wrong state" suggests that the image has been manipulated to create a humorous or satirical effect, implying that the person in the image is President Joe Biden, but the context is altered to make it appear as if he is greeting a different state than the one he is actually in.  There is nothing inherently against common sense in the image or the text. The image is a playful alteration, and the text is a description of the image's content. However, it's important to note that the image has been altered, which means that the scene depicted is not a real event but rather a creative or humorous manipulation.

The image and text appear to be a screenshot from a social media platform, possibly a news article or a post with a news-like headline. The text in the image is in Tamil, and it seems to be discussing an incident involving a DMK (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) party leader named Selvakumar. The text mentions that Selvakumar kicked a lady doctor on COVID duty.  The headline "ALSO" suggests that this is not the main focus of the article or post, but rather an additional piece of information. The text also includes a phone number, which is not appropriate to share publicly and could be a privacy concern.  The image itself shows a group of people, including a woman who appears to be in distress, and a man who is being restrained by others. The context of the image is not clear, but it seems to be a situation that has escalated to the point where the man is being held back by others.  Regarding the question about whether the text goes against common sense, it is important to note that the text is in Tamil, and without understanding the language and the context of the incident, it is difficult to determine if the text is accurate or if it is sensationalized. However, the presence of a phone number in the text is unusual and could be a sign of sensationalism or an attempt to solicit contact for further information
The text "FREE CUBA" is a political slogan advocating for the end of the United States embargo against Cuba. The image shows a group of people protesting in favor of lifting the embargo. The text "YOU NO LONGER HAVE POWER" is a statement that seems to be a call to action or a declaration of the protesters' belief that their actions will bring about change.

It is a clear and direct message from the protesters expressing their political views and their desire for change in U.S. policy towards Cuba.
The image shows a formal event where a person is signing a document at a desk, surrounded by other individuals who appear to be observing the signing. The text "Joe Biden say I dont know what Im signing" is not consistent with the visual content of the image. It is not possible to determine the exact words spoken by any individual in the image, as there is no audio or transcript available. The text appears to be a misinterpretation or a fictional representation of the event, as it does not match the visual context of the scene.
The text in the image appears to be a statement about a situation in the city of Quds, which is a term often used to refer to Jerusalem. The statement suggests that Israeli occupiers are terrorizing Palestinians in this city.  The text itself does not go against common sense. It is a statement that expresses a political opinion about a conflict that has been ongoing for many years. The statement is likely to be controversial and may be interpreted differently by different people, depending on their perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  However, it is important to note that the image itself does not provide any evidence to support the statement. It is a still image that shows a group of people standing outside a building, and there is no visible indication of any conflict or terrorism taking place. Therefore, while the statement is not inherently against common sense, it is important to approach such statements with a critical eye and to seek out reliable sources of information to form an informed opinion on the matter.

It seems to be a statement about the political climate in Georgia, specifically regarding allegations of a rigged election and the potential impact on the Senate race.  The text itself does not go against common sense. It is a statement of fact, based on the information available at the time the headline was written. However, the interpretation of the headline and the context in which it is used can be subject to different perspectives and opinions.  It's important to note that the headline is a summary of a larger story, and the full context of the story, including the evidence and arguments presented, would be necessary to fully understand the situation and the implications of the headline.
The text in the image reads: "Marsakh is Armenia!"  This statement is not accurate and goes against common sense. Marsakh is a region in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but is governed by the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, which is not recognized by most countries. Armenia is a country located in the South Caucasus region, bordering Turkey, Georgia, Iran, and the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic.  The image shows a group of figures standing in front of a banner with the text "Marsakh is Armenia!" and flags of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. This suggests that the image is likely related to a political or territorial claim by the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic or Armenia, but it does not reflect the international recognition of the region.
The image you've provided appears to be an artistic or conceptual representation of a universal coronavirus vaccine, rather than a real-world product. It shows a stylized depiction of a virus with various colors and shapes, and there's a text overlay that reads "UNIVERSAL VACCINE FOR CORONAVIRUSES."  The text "CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC" suggests that the image is related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The concept of a "universal vaccine" implies that it would provide immunity against a wide range of coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold and potentially future strains of the virus that causes COVID-19.  The text "HOW DOES IT WORK AND CAN IT PREVENT FUTURE OUTBREAKS?" indicates that the image is likely meant to be informative, explaining the concept of a universal vaccine and its potential to prevent future outbreaks of coronaviruses.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The image is likely intended to be educational or to promote the idea of scientific research and development of vaccines to combat coronaviruses. However, it's important to note that the development of a universal coronavirus vaccine is still a work in progress and the text does not provide specific

The text also indicates that the event is taking place in Barcelona, Spain, and that it is the "1st WEEKEND."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It seems to be a straightforward announcement or advertisement for an event. If there is something specific you are referring to that you believe goes against common sense, please provide more details or clarify, and I can comment further.
The text in the image does not provide any information about the iPhone applenews or the removal of the headphone jack from the iPhone.

The text "New York" is not related to the context provided in the image. The image shows a protest scene with people holding signs, but the text "New York" does not provide any information about the location of the protest or the specific cause of the protest. It is possible that the protest is taking place in New York, but without additional context, it is not possible to confirm this.  The rest of the text "Protests across the globe in support of farmers in India" is consistent with the image, which shows a group of people protesting in a city street. The text suggests that the protest is part of a larger movement taking place in various locations around the world, with the specific cause being support for farmers in India.
The image you've provided shows two different scenes of wildfires. The text accompanying the image states, "Trump is wrong about what is causing the devastating fires in California." This statement is not factual and goes against common sense. It is not appropriate to make political statements or accusations without providing evidence or context to support them. The cause of wildfires in California is a complex issue that involves a combination of factors, including climate change, drought, and human activity. It is not accurate to attribute the cause of these fires to a single individual or entity without considering the broader context and scientific understanding of the issue.
The text you provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It appears to be a statement about a viral video that is making a claim about hospital ward boys.

The image you've provided appears to be a comparison between the severity of influenza (flu) and COVID-19, based on various statistics such as the number of days between when you are first infected and start showing symptoms, the likelihood of transmission, and the average number of days a person is contagious.  From the information presented, there is nothing that directly contradicts common sense. The statistics are based on averages and are likely to be accurate within the context of the data they are derived from. However, it's important to note that the severity of both influenza and COVID-19 can vary greatly depending on individual health, age, and other factors.  The image also includes a disclaimer at the bottom stating that the source is the CDC, BMC, ACP, JAMA, and ABC News, which suggests that the information is credible and based on scientific and medical research.  If you have any specific concerns or questions about the information presented, please let me know, and I can provide more detailed feedback.
The text you provided seems to be a statement about the Wuhan Province in China, suggesting that they are cremating hundreds of people per day while China reports only dozens of virus deaths. This statement appears to be in conflict with the official reports from China, which have consistently reported a lower number of deaths from the virus.  The discrepancy between the reported number of deaths and the number of cremations is indeed unusual and would be considered out of the ordinary by most people. It's important to note that the accuracy of such a statement would depend on the credibility of the source and the veracity of the information provided.  In general, it's crucial to verify information from multiple sources before accepting it as fact, especially when it comes to sensitive or critical topics like public health emergencies.
The text in the image does not contain any information that goes against common sense.

The text you provided is a statement made by a person, which is not necessarily a factual statement. It is a political statement that reflects the person's opinion on mail-in voting. The statement is not inherently against common sense, as opinions are subjective and can vary widely among individuals. However, the statement does not provide any evidence or data to support the claim that mail-in voting is "horrible" and "corrupt."  It is important to note that the topic of mail-in voting is a subject of ongoing debate and discussion, with different opinions on its effectiveness, security, and accessibility. Some people argue that mail-in voting can be vulnerable to fraud and abuse, while others argue that it is a safe and convenient way to vote, especially during a pandemic when in-person voting may not be feasible.  In general, the statement does not go against common sense in the sense of defying basic laws of logic or reality. However, it is a statement that reflects a particular political perspective, and as such, it is subject to scrutiny and debate.
The image you've provided appears to be a map showing the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in India as of a certain date. The text indicates that the total number of confirmed cases includes those who have been cured and discharged, as well as those who have died.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The text is providing information about the current state of COVID-19 cases in India, which is a standard way of reporting such data. The inclusion of cured and discharged cases is a common practice in many countries to reflect the overall situation and recovery rate, while the inclusion of deaths is necessary to understand the severity of the disease and the impact on mortality.
The text in the image states: "COVID officially declared a pandemic by the WHO, as deaths pass , ."  There is nothing in this text that goes against common sense. The World Health Organization (WHO) did indeed declare COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020, after the number of cases and deaths had significantly increased worldwide. The text accurately reflects the timeline of the pandemic's classification by the WHO.
The text in the image does not provide any information about the number of undocumented immigrants. It only mentions that there is a border wall and a vehicle driving on a dirt road. The statement about Trump's claim regarding the number of undocumented immigrants is not related to the content of the image.
The text in the image appears to be a call to action or a statement of protest, likely related to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC), and the Shaheen Bagh protests in India. The text is a bit blurry, but it seems to be inviting people to join a discussion or protest over a cup of tea.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense.

The text is clear in its message and does not contain any nonsensical or illogical statements.
The text in the image is consistent with a news report that discusses the possibility of President Biden using executive action to cancel federal student loan debt. This is a topic of debate and discussion, with some arguing that the President has the authority to do so and others arguing that such a move would be unconstitutional or beyond the scope of the President's powers. The text itself does not go against common sense; it is a statement of a current political issue.
The text "Brutality of Indian police on peaceful Muslim protestors CAANRCNPR" appears to be a statement about an event that is described as a peaceful protest by Muslim individuals being met with violence or excessive force by the Indian police. The text is a commentary on the situation and does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It is a statement that is likely based on the visual content of the image, which shows individuals who appear to be protesting and being confronted by police.
The text in the image appears to be a nonsensical jumble of words that does not form a coherent sentence or convey any meaningful information. It does not provide any context or information that would allow for a logical interpretation. The phrase "We've found the location of on lunar surface amp" is nonsensical and does not correspond to any known event or discovery. It seems to be a random string of words without any connection to reality or common sense.
The text you've provided does not make sense and does not appear to be a coherent statement. It seems to be a nonsensical or unrelated combination of words that does not form a meaningful sentence. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the statement goes against common sense or not, as it does not convey a clear message.
The text provided with the images states, "At a glance one would mistaken these images to be from occupied Palestine." This statement is not factual and goes against common sense. The images depict a situation that appears to be a violent confrontation between civilians and military personnel, which could be mistaken for a scene from a conflict zone like Palestine. However, without additional context, it is not possible to determine the exact location or circumstances of the event. The statement is an assumption based on the visual content of the images, which may not accurately reflect the actual situation.
The text in the image states, "People protested in Berlin against the measures taken by the government to tackle the pandemic."

The text you've provided appears to be discussing the relationship between the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and the subsequent occurrence of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. It suggests that the vaccine rollout might be coinciding with an increase in these metrics, which could lead to confusion about whether the vaccine is causing the increase or if it's merely a coincidence.  The text does not contain anything that directly goes against common sense. It raises a valid point about the timing of the vaccine rollout and the subsequent increase in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, which is a topic of ongoing discussion and research.  However, it's important to note that the text does not provide any evidence or data to support the claim that the vaccine rollout is causing the increase in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. This is a complex issue that requires careful analysis of data and scientific studies to draw accurate conclusions.  In general, vaccines are designed to prevent diseases, not cause them. The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has been associated with a decrease in severe cases and deaths, as well as a reduction in the overall burden on healthcare systems. This is supported by a large body of scientific evidence and real-world data.
The text in the image states, "On February th, days ago, there were coronavirus cases in the US." This statement is factual and does not go against common sense. It is a simple observation of a past event, which is the occurrence of coronavirus cases in the United States on February 20th.
The text you provided seems to be a statement about the number of children living in poverty under a Tory government. However, the text is incomplete and does not provide any specific numbers or context for the statement. Without additional information, it is not possible to determine if the statement is accurate or if it goes against common sense.  The image you've provided appears to be a historical photograph of a group of people, possibly a family or a community, dressed in what looks like traditional or old-fashioned clothing. The text overlaying the image does not seem to be related to the content of the photograph.

The text in the image reads: "SUBURBAN MOMs 2020 FOR TRUMP."  There is nothing inherently against common sense in this text. It is a statement of support for President Trump by suburban mothers in the year 2020. The text is clear and straightforward, expressing a political viewpoint.  However, it's important to note that political opinions can be diverse and subject to interpretation. The text does not provide any additional context or information that would allow for a broader understanding of the situation or the motivations of the individuals who are part of this group.
The image shows a group of people, likely representatives from various countries, standing in front of a backdrop with the text "Nations Unite for Climate Change Conference Paris 2015." The text on the backdrop also mentions "Conference des Nations Unies sur les Changements Climatiques 2015" and "COP 21."  The Paris Agreement, which was adopted by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2015, is an international treaty on climate change. After signing the agreement, countries are expected to take action to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and to work together to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius.  The text on the backdrop does not contain anything that goes against common sense. It accurately reflects the purpose and goals of the Paris Agreement. The agreement is a common-sense response to the scientific consensus that human activities are causing climate change and that urgent action is needed to mitigate its impacts.
The image you've provided appears to show a group of children in a classroom setting, with some of them looking surprised or shocked. The text overlay on the image reads "Unbelievable."  The statement "Unbelievable" is subjective and does not necessarily go against common sense. It could be interpreted in various ways depending on the context.

Without additional context, it's difficult to determine if there's anything in the text that goes against common sense.

The text mentions that Pakistani soldiers displayed a white flag to collect their soldier's bodies after a massive fire assault by the Indian Army.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense.

The text accurately describes the historical event and the actions taken by the soldiers involved.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a statement from a government document. It is not clear what the context of the text is or how it relates to the image of the parking lot. The text seems to be discussing COVID-19 death projections, which is a serious topic.  Without additional context, it's difficult to determine if the text goes against common sense. However, if the text is indeed a news headline or a statement from a government document, it is important to consider the credibility of the source and the accuracy of the information presented.  In general, it is important to approach such statements with a critical eye and to verify the information from multiple sources before drawing conclusions.
The text "Woman believed to be the oldest ever to give birth delivers twins" is not consistent with common sense. The age of a woman giving birth is not a reliable indicator of her ability to carry a pregnancy to term or deliver healthy babies. While it is possible for older women to give birth, the likelihood of complications increases with age. Additionally, the age of a woman giving birth is not a reliable indicator of the age of the babies she is carrying. It is not uncommon for older women to have babies, but it is important to note that the age of the mother does not necessarily determine the age of the babies.
The text in the image appears to be a screenshot from a news article or a social media post, and it seems to be discussing a situation where a Chinese engineer is accused of beating his Pak driver on camera.

The text you provided does not seem to go against common sense. It describes an event where the Capitol Police are opening the doors and inviting protesters in, which is a typical scenario during a protest or demonstration.

The text in the image appears to be a mix of unrelated elements. It mentions "Crocodile found in gutter at Dadar MumbaiRains MumbaiRain live Mumbai India MondayMotivation MondayMorning SidrahDP RubeenaFarhan Azimdhunna farhanfarru," which seems to be a nonsensical combination of words.  The first part of the text, "Crocodile found in gutter at Dadar MumbaiRains MumbaiRain live Mumbai India MondayMotivation MondayMorning SidrahDP RubeenaFarhan Azimdhunna farhanfarru," is likely a typo or a mistake, as crocodiles are not typically found in gutters in urban areas like Mumbai. The presence of a crocodile in such a location would be highly unusual and would likely be a cause for concern for public safety.  The second part of the text, "Farhan Azimdhunna farhanfarru," seems to be a name, but without additional context, it's unclear how it relates to the rest of the text.  Overall, the text does not make sense and does not correspond to any known events or situations. It seems to be a random collection of words that do not form a coherent message.
The text in the image appears to be a mix of English and another language, and it seems to be discussing the "first picture of Earth Chandrayaan sent from space." However, there is a contradiction in the text. The first part of the text says "The first picture of Earth Chandrayaan sent from space," which implies that the image is from the Chandrayaan mission, which is an Indian space mission to the Moon.  The second part of the text contradicts the first by stating "The first picture of Earth from space." This statement is incorrect because the image is not from space; it is an image of the Earth taken from the surface of the Moon. The Chandrayaan mission has sent several images of the Moon, but it has not sent an image of the Earth from space.  Therefore, the text in the image is not consistent with common sense and is likely a mistake or a misinterpretation of the image's content.
The text you provided appears to be a headline or a statement from the EU Border Agency. It suggests that there is a "staggering number" of jihadis entering Europe. However, without additional context or evidence, it is not possible to determine the accuracy of this statement.

The use of this term in a headline or statement can be controversial and may not be appropriate in all contexts.  It is important to approach such statements with a critical eye, considering the source of the information and the evidence or data that is being cited. It is also crucial to consider the potential impact of such statements on public opinion and the potential for spreading fear or misinformation.
The text you provided appears to be a summary of a news story or a tweet. It mentions Jake Tapper, a news anchor, repeatedly pressing a Trump trade adviser on whether China tariffs are hurting US consumers.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense.

The image appears to be a screenshot from a news broadcast, and the text includes a statement that reads, "We have found location of Lander Vikram on lunar surface." This statement is not consistent with the current state of knowledge about the Lander Vikram, which is part of the Chandrayaan-2 mission to the Moon.  The Lander Vikram was expected to land on the lunar surface on September 7, 2019. However, it was reported that the lander had experienced a hard landing and was not in contact with the mission control center. Since then, there have been no official confirmations of the lander's location or status.  The statement in the image, suggesting that the location of the lander has been found, goes against the widely reported and confirmed information that the lander's status is unknown and it is not in contact with the mission control center. This suggests that the information in the image is not accurate and may be speculative or misleading.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a statement related to the World Health Organization (WHO). However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine if the text goes against common sense. The headline mentions "January" and "WHO," but without more information, it's not possible to assess the accuracy or relevance of the statement.  In general, news headlines and statements should be factual and not go against common sense. If a statement is contradictory to widely accepted facts or principles, it would likely be considered misleading or inaccurate.  If you have any specific concerns about the text in the image, please provide more details or context so I can assist you better.
The image shows a child standing in front of a chair with a picture of a man on it, and the child appears to be touching the picture with a hand on their face.

Without additional context, it's difficult to determine if there's anything in the text that goes against common sense. If you're referring to the text "Heart touching pic." as part of the image, it's a simple description of the child's action and does not contain any information that would contradict common sense.

It is always advisable to verify news reports with multiple sources before drawing conclusions.
The text you provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It describes an event called "Event 201" which is a high-level pandemic exercise hosted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The text does not contain any information that would be considered unusual or counterintuitive.
The text you've provided does not mention Marcel Marceau or his involvement in saving children from the Holocaust. It appears to be a description of a photograph or a scene from a play or film.

The text in the image appears to be a headline from a news program, and it reads:  "'INCONVENIENT TRUTH'  A ray of hope for scientists after Lander Vikram traced on the moon."  The headline seems to be a play on words, combining the title of a well-known documentary about climate change with a recent event involving the Indian lunar mission, Chandrayaan-2. The text suggests that the discovery of the Vikram lander on the moon is a positive development for scientists, which is a reasonable interpretation of the situation.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward statement about a scientific discovery. However, it's important to note that the actual content of the news program would provide more context and information about the story, which may not be fully conveyed by the headline alone.
The text you've provided appears to be a quote from a news article or a speech discussing the exponential growth of the new coronavirus variant. It mentions that exponential growth can lead to a situation where nobody wants to look at the eye, which is a metaphorical way of saying that the situation is so dire that people are avoiding it.  The text does not contain anything that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward explanation of how exponential growth can lead to a rapid increase in the number of cases, which is a well-understood concept in epidemiology. The text also mentions the importance of taking swift and aggressive action to prevent the spread of the virus, which is a common sense approach to managing a pandemic.

The text in the image appears to be a quote from Dr. Benjamin Lee, University of Vermont, which seems to be a statement about the risks of children wearing masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The statement is as follows:  "Ultimately, we are not putting children at risk by asking that they wear a mask. When everyone wears a mask, even children, that makes everyone's child more safe."  This statement is consistent with common sense and public health guidelines. It suggests that wearing masks can help reduce the spread of respiratory droplets, which can contain the virus that causes COVID-19. This is a measure that has been widely recommended by health authorities to reduce the risk of transmission, especially in situations where social distancing is not possible.  The statement does not contain any false or misleading claims about the risks of children wearing masks. It is a statement that aligns with the scientific consensus on the use of masks to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
The text "This rare yellow turtle was spotted in Odisha" is not consistent with common sense. Turtles are not naturally yellow, and the image provided does not show a yellow turtle. The color of turtles is typically determined by their species and the environment they live in. Most turtles have a pattern of colors, including shades of brown, green, and sometimes black, which are determined by the melanin pigment in their skin.  The image shows a turtle with a yellowish hue, which is unusual and not consistent with the natural coloration of turtles. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as the lighting conditions when the photo was taken, the presence of dirt or algae on the turtle's shell, or even a rare genetic variation. However, it is not a natural color for turtles.  The news text is likely inaccurate or misleading, as it does not correspond to the actual appearance of the turtle in the image.
The text provided in the image seems to be a description of a protest event. It mentions a large gathering of people in a street, which is consistent with what is visible in the image. The text also refers to a protest against India, which is a common occurrence in the context of the Kashmir region and its relationship with India.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It appears to be a straightforward description of a protest event, which is a legitimate form of expression and is often reported in news media. The text does not contain any information that would be considered unusual or counterintuitive.
The text in the image states: "With three major coronavirus outbreaks in the last two decades first SARSCoV, then MERSCoV, and now SARSCoV that causes COVID another outbreak is inevitable."  This statement is not accurate according to current scientific understanding. The text is likely referring to the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak in 2002-2003, the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak that has been ongoing since 2012, and the COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) pandemic that began in late 2019.  However, the statement that "another outbreak is inevitable" is not supported by scientific evidence. The emergence of new viruses is a natural part of the evolution of pathogens, but the frequency and severity of outbreaks can be influenced by various factors, including the effectiveness of public health measures, the emergence of new variants, and the impact of climate change on the environment.  It is important to note that the text in the image is likely meant to be a headline or a catchy statement to attract attention, rather than a statement based on scientific consensus.
The text appears to be a summary of a survey or study regarding the willingness of adults to get vaccinated against COVID-19. It lists various reasons why people might be more likely to get vaccinated, such as if it was offered at their place of care, if they were offered free transportation from a ride-share company, or if it received full USFDA approval.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It seems to be a straightforward presentation of data or findings from a survey or study. The text is factual and does not contain any information that contradicts basic principles of health and safety, such as the importance of vaccinations for public health.

The text in the image appears to be a news headline, and it seems to be reporting on an event related to a rocket landing in the Indian Ocean. The headline mentions that the rocket's components were destroyed upon reentry into the Earth's atmosphere.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward statement of an event that has occurred. The headline is likely referring to a specific rocket launch that did not go as planned, resulting in the rocket's components being destroyed upon reentry.
The text provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It is a statement from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) acknowledging a link between the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine and blood clots, but also stating that the cause of this link is still unknown. This is a factual statement that is consistent with the scientific process of understanding the safety and efficacy of vaccines.
The text in the image appears to be a headline from a news source, which seems to be a reputable one, given the logo. The headline suggests that delaying children's vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic could increase the risk of other outbreaks.  The statement "Putting off kids' vaccines during COVID heightens risk of other outbreaks" is consistent with common sense and scientific understanding. Vaccines are crucial for protecting individuals and communities from infectious diseases. Delaying vaccinations can lead to a decrease in herd immunity, which means that more people become susceptible to diseases, increasing the risk of outbreaks.  Therefore, the text in the image does not go against common sense. It is a statement that aligns with public health guidelines and recommendations.
The text you provided seems to be a statement about a protest, but it does not provide any specific details about the protest or the context in which it is taking place. Without more information, it's difficult to determine if the statement is accurate or if it goes against common sense.  However, the statement does not inherently go against common sense. It is a subjective observation that could be true or false depending on the specific circumstances of the protest. If the protest is indeed the largest in the world and not receiving enough attention, that could be considered a statement of fact. If the protest is not the largest and is receiving adequate attention, then the statement would be considered false or misleading.  It's important to note that the size of a protest and the level of attention it receives can be subjective and can vary greatly depending on the source of the information and the context in which the protest is taking place.
The text in the image is in Portuguese and it reads: "Metro vence a primeira jogada o cícuma para lanterna." This translates to "Metro wins the first throw of the coin."  The context of the text is related to a soccer match, where the first throw of the coin is used to decide which team will kick off the game. The statement is a play on words, as "lanterna" can also mean "lantern," and in the context of a coin toss, it would be "lantern" that is being referred to. The phrase "devastating to Americas energy producers" is not related to the content of the image or the text. It seems to be an unrelated statement or a headline from a different article.  The image itself shows a soccer match in progress, with players on the field and a goalkeeper in the goal. The text is likely a commentary or a headline related to the match, but without additional context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of the statement.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a summary of a news article. It mentions "COVID-19 INFORMATION" and "UPDATED CASE NUMBERS," which suggests that the content is related to the current status of COVID-19 cases. The text also includes a source, "Alberta.ca/covid19," indicating that the information is likely from the official government website of Alberta, Canada.  The text does not contain any information that goes against common sense.

The text in the image appears to be a statement about former U.S. President Joe Biden's involvement in the Iraq War. The statement suggests that Biden not only voted for the war but also actively pushed for it. This is a common point of criticism regarding Biden's stance on the Iraq War during his time as a senator.  The statement is consistent with historical records and is not contrary to common sense. It reflects the political position that Biden took at the time, which is a matter of public record.

The text you've provided appears to be a statement made by a person, which seems to be a political figure given the context of the image. The statement "This clarification by Reliance is bogus." is a subjective opinion and does not necessarily go against common sense. It seems to be a commentary on a specific event or announcement, which may or may not be accurate or fair.  However, without additional context or information about the event or announcement in question, it's difficult to determine if the statement is factually accurate or not. It's important to consider the source of the statement and the context in which it was made when evaluating its validity.
The text "Face masks could be giving wearers coronavirus immunity, experts suggest" is not consistent with current scientific understanding of COVID-19 and face masks.

The idea that face masks could provide immunity to COVID-19 is not supported by credible scientific evidence.

However, it is important to note that the interpretation and implementation of such a resolution can be subject to different perspectives and opinions. Some people may view it as a necessary measure to maintain stability and security, while others may see it as a violation of Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms.
The text "Rare Glowing Blue Waves Spotted on Chennai Beach Chennai bioluminescence" seems to be a headline or a title for an article or video. It is not a statement that goes against common sense. The headline is describing an unusual and possibly rare occurrence, which is the presence of bioluminescent waves on a beach in Chennai. Bioluminescence is a natural phenomenon where certain organisms emit light, often due to a chemical reaction within their bodies. It is not uncommon for certain beaches to have bioluminescent waves, especially those with high concentrations of algae or other light-emitting organisms.  The image shows a person holding a bunch of grapes, which is not related to the headline. The person appears to be smiling and is wearing a green jacket. The background features a blue sky with clouds, which does not seem to be related to the headline either.

The text is consistent with what one would expect to read about a protest event, and there is nothing inherently contradictory or nonsensical in the text.
The text in the image says, "surprise, these are working." This statement is not necessarily against common sense, as it is a play on words. The phrase "these are working" is typically used to describe a product or service that is functioning properly.

The phrase is meant to be humorous, suggesting that the campaign is effective and surprising in its success.

The update provides factual information about the ongoing health crisis, including the number of cases and deaths, as well as the measures taken to contain the spread of the virus. The information is consistent with what we would expect from a reputable news source.
The text in the image appears to be a statement about a person's political beliefs, specifically the wearing of a "Make Whites Great Again" hat, which is often associated with certain political ideologies. The statement implies that the person wearing the hat is racist and should not be a police officer.  However, the text does not provide any evidence to support the claim that the person in the image is Derek Chauvin, the police officer who was involved in the death of George Floyd. The image shows a different individual, who is not Derek Chauvin.  The text also does not provide any evidence to support the claim that the person in the image is a police officer. The image shows a different individual who is not a police officer.  Therefore, the text goes against common sense because it makes unsubstantiated claims about the identity and profession of the person in the image.
The image appears to be a screenshot from a video game, specifically from a game that involves characters with various abilities and statistics. The text in the image is in Japanese, and it seems to be related to the game's content, possibly indicating in-game currency or points.  The news text at the bottom of the image mentions "Taipei reported multiple Chinese jets and bombers had flown into its air defence zone." This statement is not against common sense; it is a factual report of an event that occurred. The presence of the news text in the image suggests that the game's developers or the game itself is trying to convey a message or context related to the game's content or theme.  Without additional context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of the game or the intent behind the inclusion of the news text. However, the news text itself is not contradicting common sense or presenting any information that would be considered unusual or out of place.
The text in the image appears to be a statement made by a politician, which is consistent with common sense.

The text is likely intended to provide context or information about the artist and the art itself.
The text in the image appears to be a projection by the Associated Press (AP) that Joe Biden has won the battleground state of Michigan. This is a common sense conclusion based on the information provided by the AP, which is a reputable news organization known for its accurate and timely election projections. The image also shows a map with the states of Michigan, Biden's total vote count, and Trump's total vote count, which is a typical way to visualize the results of an election. There is nothing in the text or the image that goes against common sense.
The text in the image appears to be a fact check statement, which is generally designed to provide accurate and unbiased information. It is not clear from the image alone whether the statement is factually accurate or not, as it would depend on the context of the statement and the specific claims being made.  However, the statement "Fact Check Trumps Deceptive Ad on Biden and Defunding the Police" suggests that the image is intended to challenge or correct information presented in a political advertisement by the Trump campaign. This implies that the statement is likely to be critical of the Trump campaign's advertisement, suggesting that it contains misinformation or deception.  In general, fact check statements are designed to provide a clear and unbiased assessment of the accuracy of a claim or statement. If the statement in the image is factually accurate, it would be consistent with common sense and the principles of factual reporting. If the statement is inaccurate or misleading, it would not be consistent with common sense or journalistic standards.
The text in the image appears to be a screenshot of a social media post or a news article. It states, "Doctors with DrsCovidEthics say Covid vaccines are unnecessary and ineffective, halt the use of covid vaccines in children and adolescents."  The statement that "Covid vaccines are unnecessary and ineffective" is a controversial and debatable claim. Many health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), have endorsed the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. These organizations have conducted extensive research and clinical trials to support the use of these vaccines.  The claim that "Covid vaccines are unnecessary and ineffective" goes against the consensus of mainstream medical and scientific communities. It is important to note that the effectiveness of vaccines can vary depending on factors such as the individual's health, age, and the specific vaccine being used. However, the overall consensus is that COVID-19 vaccines are a crucial tool in preventing the spread of the virus and reducing the severity of illness.  The statement about halting the use of COVID-19 vaccines in children and adolescents is also a matter of ongoing debate. The decision to vaccinate children and adolescents is typically made by healthcare providers and
The text in the image appears to be a promotional advertisement for video game skins rather than a news report. It is not related to the content of the news text you provided.

It is a straightforward statement of fact regarding Ukraine's participation in these international treaties. The text is informative and seems to be part of a presentation or report.
The text in the image claims that the blacking out of Hindi text on signboards is being done by farmers as part of their ongoing protest. However, the images provided do not show any farmers or any indication that the blacking out is being done by them. Instead, the images show a person in a turban, who appears to be a Sikh, engaging in the act of blacking out the text.  The claim that farmers are involved in this activity is not supported by the visual evidence presented in the images. It is possible that the person in the turban is a farmer, but without additional context, it is not possible to confirm this. The claim that this is part of a protest is also not substantiated by the images.  The text in the image is likely to be misleading or inaccurate, as it does not align with the visual evidence provided. It is important to verify such claims with reliable sources before sharing them.

However, there is no evidence in the image to suggest that any of the individuals are Hindu brides who have been abducted, converted to Islam, and forcibly married.

The text is consistent with what one would expect to hear about a significant protest event.
The text in the image appears to be a statement attributed to President Trump, suggesting that he blames former President Obama for the Russian annexation of Crimea. However, this statement goes against common sense and historical facts.  The annexation of Crimea by Russia occurred in 2014, after the ousting of Ukraine's pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. The annexation was widely condemned by the international community, including the United States under President Obama. The United States, along with the European Union and other countries, imposed economic sanctions on Russia in response to the annexation.  Therefore, it is not accurate to say that President Obama "lost Crimea" to Russia, as the annexation was a unilateral action taken by Russia and not a result of any failure or loss on the part of the United States or President Obama. The statement in the image is a misrepresentation of the historical events and is likely intended to be misleading or to provoke a reaction.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline, but it is not related to the content of the image, which shows a scene from a TV show or movie.

The text you provided is a statement made by Donald Trump, which is not a factual statement based on common sense or widely accepted historical records.

The text provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It describes a scene where a US Army band is playing the Indian national anthem, "Jana Gana Mana," for Indian soldiers. This is a common occurrence during joint military exercises or events where the two countries come together. The text also mentions that the video is viral, which is a common occurrence for such events, as they often capture a moment of cultural exchange and camaraderie between the two nations.
The text in the image reads: "USA U basketball standing next to El Salvador U basketball team final score was 100-0."  This statement is not consistent with common sense or the rules of basketball. In basketball, the score is typically displayed as a numerical value, with the team that has scored more points having the higher number. A score of 100-0 would be highly unusual and would not be possible under standard basketball scoring rules, which typically range from 0 to 100 points.  The score of 100-0 is likely a typographical error or a misprint, as it defies the basic principles of the sport. The actual score would be a more reasonable number, such as 100-0, 99-0, or 100-100, depending on the actual score at the time the photo was taken.
The text "Woman, , becomes oldest new mum in the world after giving birth to twins" is a headline that seems to be a contradiction in terms. The age of the woman is not specified, but the fact that she is described as the "oldest new mum" suggests that she is elderly. However, the fact that she is giving birth to twins is unusual because it is less common for older women to become pregnant and give birth to twins.  The headline is likely a sensationalized or exaggerated statement designed to grab attention. It is not uncommon for media outlets to use such headlines to create a sense of novelty or to highlight a particular story. However, without more context or information, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of the headline.
The text in the image appears to be a statement made by President Donald Trump, which seems to be a political statement rather than a factual one. The statement is about the Democratic Party's representation of Trump's Supreme Court nominees.  The statement "Trump falsely claims Dem misrepresented SCOTUS picks criticism of Trump" suggests that the Democratic Party's representation of Trump's Supreme Court nominees is being misrepresented. However, without additional context, it's not possible to determine if the statement is factually accurate or not.  In general, political statements can be subjective and may not always align with common sense or objective facts. It's important to approach such statements with a critical eye and to seek out reliable sources of information to verify the accuracy of claims made by politicians.
The text in the image appears to be a screenshot from a social media post with a headline that reads "Biden Makes Comment So Outrageously False Even MSNBC Just FactChecked Him VIDEO." The headline suggests that there is a video of President Joe Biden making a comment that is so false that even MSNBC, a news network, felt the need to fact-check him.  However, without the context of the video or the specific comment made by President Biden, it's not possible to determine if the comment is indeed false or if the headline is accurate. It's important to approach such claims with a critical eye and to verify information from multiple sources before sharing or believing it.
The text provided in the image seems to be a factual description of an event.

The text "Arizona voters fear ballots weren't counted because they used Sharpies" is a statement that suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between using Sharpie markers to fill out ballots and the possibility that those ballots were not counted. However, this statement is not based on common sense or factual evidence.  The use of Sharpie markers to fill out ballots is a common practice in many jurisdictions, and there is no evidence to suggest that using Sharpies in this way affects the counting of ballots. The statement is likely a misinterpretation or a sensationalized headline designed to provoke concern or controversy.  In reality, the counting of ballots is typically done using optical scanners that read the marks made by ink pens or ballpoint pens. The type of ink used is not a factor that would affect the scanning process. The statement is not consistent with the way elections are conducted and counted in the United States.
The text "Terrifying moment houses are swept away as intense flooding hits Turkey" is a description of a natural disaster event. It is a factual statement that accurately reflects the situation depicted in the image. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The image shows a flooded area with houses partially submerged, which is a clear indication of the severity of the flood.
The text you provided does not seem to go against common sense. It states that there is a discrepancy between a statement made by President Trump and the actual crime statistics in Germany.

The image itself is blurry and lacks clear details that would allow for a definitive conclusion. Therefore, the statement is not necessarily against common sense, but it is important to approach such claims with caution and to verify the information through reliable sources.
The text in the image appears to be a snippet from a news broadcast or a video, and it seems to be discussing the measures that can be taken to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The text mentions "hand washing, social distancing, and amp," which could be referring to "amplifying" the message about these measures.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. Hand washing and social distancing are widely recognized as effective ways to reduce the risk of contracting and spreading viruses, including coronaviruses. These practices are supported by public health authorities worldwide.  The text is cut off, so it's not possible to determine if there is more context that might provide additional information. However, based on what is visible, the text seems to be promoting common-sense practices for disease prevention.
The text you provided appears to be a fictional or hypothetical scenario, as it is not consistent with any known real-life events. The text describes a situation where a woman is arrested for stabbing her husband multiple times after finding pictures of him having sex with "another woman," but the twist is that the woman in the pictures is actually the woman who was stabbed.  This scenario goes against common sense because it is highly improbable that someone would be arrested for stabbing their spouse after finding out that they were the one in the pictures. The text seems to be designed to create a shocking or humorous effect, but it is not a realistic depiction of a criminal investigation or a domestic violence situation.
The text in the image states: "At least two caucus meetings at the DNC intentionally dropped under God from the Pledge of Allegiance."  This statement is factually accurate. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) did indeed remove the phrase "under God" from the Pledge of Allegiance at two caucus meetings. This decision was made to ensure inclusivity and to avoid any perception of favoritism towards any particular religious group.  The decision to remove the phrase "under God" from the Pledge of Allegiance is a matter of policy and is not inherently against common sense. It is a political decision made by the DNC to address concerns about inclusivity and to ensure that all attendees at the caucus meetings feel welcome and included.
The image shows a person with what appears to be a yellow substance on their hair and face. The text "BREAKING REPORTgt" suggests that this is a significant or unexpected event. However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine if there's anything in the text that goes against common sense. The image itself does not provide enough information to make a definitive statement about the situation. If you have more information or a specific part of the text you're referring to, please provide it, and I can comment further.
The text provided with the images states, "At a glance one would mistaken these images to be from occupied Palestine." This statement is not factual and goes against common sense. The images depict a situation that appears to be a violent confrontation between civilians and military personnel, which could be mistaken for a scene from a conflict zone like Palestine. However, without additional context, it is not possible to determine the exact location or circumstances of the event. The statement is an assumption based on the visual content of the images, which may not accurately reflect the actual situation.
The text in the images appears to be a political statement, and it seems to be using a photo of Cynthia Patag to convey a message. The text includes phrases like "vote straight OTSOS," "never again," and "doctor image," which are likely referring to political candidates or parties. The phrase "doctor image" is particularly unusual, as it doesn't make sense in the context of a political statement. It's possible that it's a typo or a mistake in the text.  The rest of the text seems to be a call to action, urging people to vote straight for a particular party or candidate. The use of a photo of a public figure to promote a political message is a common tactic in political campaigns, but the specific message and the context in which it's being used are not clear from the image alone.  Without additional context, it's difficult to determine if the text goes against common sense. However, the use of a photo of a public figure to promote a political message could be seen as manipulative or disrespectful, depending on the context and the intentions of the person or group using the image.
The text in the image suggests that the Shree Ram Temple in Ayodhya is a significant architectural achievement and that it should be considered for inclusion in the Wonders of the World. However, it is important to note that the image itself is a digital rendering or a photograph of a model, not an actual photograph of the completed temple. Therefore, the text is not describing an existing structure but rather a proposed or conceptual one.  The statement "Once constructed, Shree Ram Temple in Ayodhya must be India's official entry for Wonders of the World" is a subjective opinion and not a factual statement. It is not uncommon for people to have differing opinions about what constitutes a wonder of the world, and the inclusion of a new site would require a formal process of evaluation by the relevant international bodies.  The text does not go against common sense in the sense of presenting an unrealistic or impossible scenario. It is a statement of aspiration or hope for the future, reflecting the significance of the temple in the context of Indian culture and history.
The text "Trump has been so abusive to women AP Photo" is a statement of opinion and is not a factual statement. It is not possible to determine from the image alone whether the statement is accurate or not, as it would require additional context and information to assess the truthfulness of the claim.
The text in the image appears to be a statement about the death of Diego Maradona, a famous footballer, and his support for the Palestine cause. The statement is consistent with the image, which shows three men holding a flag with the word "Palestine" on it. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The statement is factual and does not contain any information that would be considered unusual or untrue.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a statement about Rudy Giuliani's tweet. It mentions that Giuliani's tweet about murders in Chicago is "wildly wrong." This suggests that the tweet contains inaccurate or misleading information about the number of murders in Chicago over the weekend.  Without more context, it's not possible to determine the specifics of Giuliani's tweet or the nature of the inaccuracies. However, the statement implies that the information provided in the tweet does not align with the actual number of murders in Chicago during the specified time period.  It's important to note that making statements without verifying the facts can lead to misinformation and misunderstandings. It's always advisable to fact-check information before sharing it, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like crime statistics.
The text you provided seems to be a summary of events related to protests in London, specifically mentioning "Khalistani" flags and the presence of individuals associated with the Khalistan movement. The text also mentions the Federation of Sikh Organization (FSO) and Bhindranwale T-shirts, which are associated with the Khalistani movement.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It appears to be a factual summary of events that have occurred. However, it's important to note that the text is a summary and may not include all the details of the events.
The text in the image appears to be a question posed to a person, likely a politician or public figure, asking if they regret a specific statement or action. The question is: "Q: Do you regret what you said?"  There is nothing inherently against common sense in the text itself. It is a straightforward question that is commonly asked in interviews or discussions to gauge a person's feelings about a past statement or action. However, the context of the question, the identity of the person being asked, and the specific statement or action in question are not provided in the image, so it's not possible to determine if the question is appropriate or if the answer would be considered reasonable or not.
The image you've provided appears to be a graph showing the number of positive (P) and negative (N) trials for hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in relation to the number of trials conducted. The graph is divided into two sections: one for trials with positive results (P-0.34 by log rank) and one for trials with negative results (N-0.34 by log rank).  The text "SOOC plus HCQ" suggests that the graph is comparing the outcomes of studies that included both sulfonamide oxychloroquine (SOOC) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) versus studies that did not include HCQ.  The graph shows a rapid decline in the number of positive trials, with the number of negative trials remaining relatively stable. The text "Days from randomisation" indicates that the trials are being tracked over time, with the most recent data point being at 23 days.  The text "75 73 70 69 68 67 66 65 64 63 62 61 60 59 58 57 56 55 54 53 52 51 50 49 48 47 46 45 44
The text in the image appears to be a news headline from Reuters. It states: "BREAKING NEWS: JUST IN UK alongside European allies now recognizes Juan Guaido as interim constitutional president in Venezuela until credible elections can be held Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt on Twitter."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The headline is reporting a political development where the United Kingdom and some European countries have recognized Juan Guaido as the interim constitutional president of Venezuela, following his declaration of the position. This is a legitimate and expected action for foreign governments to take when there is a political crisis and a clear alternative to the incumbent leader.  The headline is clear and concise, providing the reader with the essential information about the situation in Venezuela and the actions taken by the UK and its allies.
The text in the image reads: "Dear Donald Hands off our Medicare, Medicaid, EPA, Department of Education, amp."  There is nothing in this text that goes against common sense. It is a statement expressing a desire for the government to not interfere with or make changes to certain programs and departments, which are commonly associated with healthcare, environmental protection, and education. These are areas where many people feel strongly about preserving or expanding services, and the text reflects that sentiment.
The text you provided seems to be a statement that is not supported by the image. The image shows two men shaking hands, but there is no indication in the image that they are Bill Clinton and Vladimir Putin, or that the meeting took place in June. Additionally, there is no evidence in the image that ten Russian agents were released by Obama without charges in July.  The statement in the text is not consistent with the information that can be discerned from the image. It appears to be a piece of misinformation or a speculative statement that is not based on the visual content of the image.
The image you've provided is an infographic titled "History of Pandemics," which appears to be a visual representation of various pandemics throughout history. The text accompanying the infographic provides information about the prevalence of pandemics, the impact of pandemics on human history, and the role of pandemics in shaping societies.  From the text and the visual elements, there doesn't seem to be anything that goes against common sense. The infographic is factual and provides a historical context for pandemics. It's important to note that while the infographic is informative, it's always crucial to verify information from multiple sources, especially when it comes to health-related topics.  The statement you've made, "Seeing the history of pandemics, it gives me hope that Corona virus indeed will test us but it will not defeat us," is a personal sentiment and not a factual statement. It reflects the individual's perspective on the current pandemic situation and their belief in human resilience.
The text in the image appears to be a summary of poll results from the New York Times/Siena College poll conducted in October 2020. It shows the results for various states, including Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The poll results indicate the percentage of support for the two major candidates at that time, Joe Biden and Donald Trump.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The poll results are presented in a straightforward manner, showing the percentage of support for each candidate in each state. The numbers are based on the data collected by the polling organization and are likely to be accurate within the margin of error for the poll.
The text appears to be discussing a legal case or a series of legal cases, and it mentions that a judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has thrown out a case on standing, not on the actual evidence. This statement is consistent with the legal principle that a plaintiff must have standing to bring a case to court, which means they must have suffered a concrete and particularized injury that is traceable to the defendant's actions and likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.  The text also mentions that the Trump campaign's allegations of voter fraud have been thrown out, which is consistent with the fact that numerous lawsuits filed by the Trump campaign challenging the results of the 2020 presidential election were dismissed by courts for lack of evidence.  The text does not contain any statements that go against common sense. It is a straightforward summary of legal proceedings and decisions.
The text in the image appears to be a congratulatory message for the states of New Jersey, Arizona, Mississippi, Montana, and South Dakota for their historic votes. However, without additional context, it's not clear what specific votes or events are being referred to. The message seems to be a positive one, but without more information, it's not possible to determine if there's anything in the text that goes against common sense.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline that reads "Dr. Taison Bell, Critical Care Physician." There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward statement about a person's profession.
The text in the image appears to be a screenshot from a news broadcast or a social media post. It states, "The FBI Is Investigating The Trump Supporters Who Were Seemingly Driving Out A BidenHarris Campaign Bus."  There is nothing inherently against common sense in this statement. It is a factual report of an investigation by the FBI into an incident involving a campaign bus. The statement is based on information that has been publicly reported and is not contradictory to common sense.  However, it is important to note that the context of the image and the source of the information are not provided, so it's crucial to verify the accuracy of the news report or social media post before accepting it as fact.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a summary of a news story. It reads: "STUDY: U.S. importers, not China, paying for most tariffs."  The statement "STUDY: U.S. importers, not China, paying for most tariffs" is a factual statement based on the information provided. It suggests that a study has found that the costs of tariffs are being borne by U.S. importers rather than by China. This is a common sense interpretation of the statement, as tariffs are taxes imposed on imports, and the burden of these taxes would typically fall on the importers rather than the exporters.  The rest of the text in the image seems to be a typical news headline, providing context for the study and its implications. It mentions that the study was conducted by CNN, and it includes a time stamp indicating when the news segment was broadcast.  Without additional context, it's not possible to determine if there's anything else in the text that goes against common sense. The statement about tariffs is consistent with economic principles and is a straightforward interpretation of the information presented.
The text in the image appears to be a statement of solidarity and support for equity farmers markets and the Black Lives Matter movement. It does not contain any information that goes against common sense. The statement is clear and concise, expressing a commitment to promoting equity and racial justice in the context of farmers markets.
The image shows a person being lifted in the air by two others, and there is a text overlay that reads "FACT? CHECK HOAX SLAYER." This suggests that the image may have been shared with the intention of debunking a false claim or rumor. The text does not provide any specific information about the person being lifted or the context of the image.  The text "FACT? CHECK HOAX SLAYER" is a call to action for viewers to verify the authenticity of the image and the claims being made about it. This is a common practice in the digital age, where misinformation can spread rapidly.  Without additional context, it's not possible to determine if the person being lifted is a wrestler named Priya Malik or if she won gold for India at the Tokyo Olympics. The image alone does not provide enough information to confirm these details.
The text you provided seems to be a headline or a statement that is not supported by the image. The image shows a man and a woman walking together, but there is no indication in the image that they are involved in any legal or political controversy, nor is there any visible text that would suggest the content of the news text you mentioned.  The statement about Flynn's lawyer accusing Obama of framing Flynn is not something that can be confirmed or denied by looking at the image. It would require additional context or information to determine its accuracy.  In general, it's important to be cautious about accepting news headlines or statements without verifying their accuracy through reliable sources.
The text you provided appears to be a statement about the cost of travel for a president, comparing the spending habits of two different presidents. Without additional context, it's difficult to determine if the statement is accurate or if it goes against common sense.  However, if we consider the statement in isolation, it does not inherently go against common sense. It's a factual statement that could be true or false depending on the specifics of the travel expenses for each president.  If the statement is based on accurate and reliable data, it would be a straightforward observation. If the statement is based on inaccurate or misleading data, it could be considered misleading or incorrect.  It's important to note that without more information, it's impossible to determine the accuracy of the statement.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline that reads: "Latest on COVID After more than two months of inaction by DrTedros, WHO finally announced that COVID is now a pandemic."  The statement "COVID is now a pandemic" is not against common sense. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020, which was widely reported and acknowledged by health authorities and the general public. The term "pandemic" refers to a global outbreak of a disease that affects a large number of people across multiple countries or continents.  The rest of the text seems to be a commentary on the response of the WHO and its Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, to the COVID-19 outbreak. It suggests that there was a delay in the WHO's response to the outbreak, which is a matter of public health and international cooperation.  The image itself shows a busy street scene with a large truck and several pedestrians, which does not seem to have any direct relation to the COVID-19 pandemic or the WHO's response to it.
The text you provided seems to be a sensationalized headline that is not supported by the image. The image shows a large crowd of people, many of whom are wearing headscarves, which is common attire in many Muslim-majority countries. However, there is no evidence in the image to suggest that any of the individuals are Hindu brides who have been abducted, converted to Islam, and forcibly married.  The headline appears to be a misleading or inaccurate representation of the situation depicted in the image. It is important to be cautious when sharing or reporting on news stories, as sensationalized headlines can contribute to the spread of misinformation.
The image you've provided appears to be an artistic representation rather than a depiction of a real event. It shows a moon with a face, crying or screaming, with a missile or bomb flying towards it. The text "Besides dropping them into hurricanes, nuclear bombs have inspired a lot of other bad ideas." is a statement that seems to be a commentary on the use of nuclear weapons and the potential for their misuse.  The statement itself is not inherently against common sense, as it is a factual observation about the history of nuclear weapons and their potential for causing harm. However, the image itself is a piece of art and not a depiction of a real event, so it is not a representation of common sense.  The image is likely intended to be a statement on the dangers of nuclear weapons and the potential for their misuse, rather than a literal depiction of a scenario.
The text you provided does not seem to be related to the image you've shared. The image shows a person wearing black stockings and high heels, bent over with their backside facing the camera. The text appears to be unrelated to the image, discussing a political incident in Buldhana, Maharashtra.  Regarding the statement about a video from Buldhana, Maharashtra, it is important to verify the accuracy of such claims. It is not uncommon for videos to be mislabeled or shared with false information. Therefore, it is crucial to fact-check such claims before sharing them.  In general, when sharing information, it is important to ensure that the source is reliable and that the information is accurate. Misinformation can spread quickly and can have serious consequences, especially in the context of political events.
The text you provided seems to be a sensationalized or misleading headline. It is not appropriate to make assumptions about the content of the image based on a headline without context. The image you've provided shows a large crowd of people, many of whom are wearing headscarves, which is common in many cultures and religious groups. The context of the image is not clear, and it is not appropriate to speculate on the circumstances or the identities of the individuals in the photo. It is important to approach such images and headlines with caution and to seek out reliable sources of information for a more accurate understanding of events.
The text provided in the image appears to be a description of a political rally in Pakistan, where slogans of "Jeevay Jeevay Pakistan" are raised and Pakistani flags are hoisted. The text does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It seems to be a straightforward description of a political event.
The text in the image reads: "Will warm weather really kill off Covid? COVID-19? COVVID-19?"  The text seems to be a question posed by the publication, Future Planet, asking if warm weather will effectively combat the spread of COVID-19. The image accompanying the text shows a snowy street with a person wearing a fur coat and a face mask, which suggests that the photo was taken during the winter season.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The question is a legitimate one, as the impact of weather on the transmission of viruses is a topic of ongoing research and discussion. It is generally believed that warmer weather can help slow the spread of COVID-19, as the virus is more stable and transmissible in colder temperatures. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of warm weather in controlling the spread of COVID-19 is not solely dependent on temperature and can be influenced by a variety of factors, including public health measures, vaccination rates, and individual behaviors.
The text in the image reads, "This Baby Wont Stop Breathing!" which is a humorous and exaggerated statement. It is not a factual observation, as babies do not have the ability to stop breathing. The statement is likely meant to be funny or to emphasize the baby's active breathing. It is not a statement that goes against common sense, as it is a playful and non-serious comment.
The image shows a person sitting amidst a large quantity of vegetables, including what appears to be a significant amount of cucumbers. The text "Mrs." is not part of the image and does not provide any context or information that would go against common sense.  From the image alone, it seems like a typical scene of someone possibly selling or sorting vegetables. There is nothing inherently unusual or against common sense that can be determined from the image alone. If there is a specific aspect of the image or the text that you are questioning, please provide more details or clarify what you are referring to.
The text you provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It is a statement attributed to Yogi Adityanath, the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, India, regarding the possibility of lockdowns in certain districts of the state. The statement is consistent with the measures taken by governments around the world to control the spread of infectious diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
The text provided seems to be a description of a historical photograph, which appears to show four individuals who are likely to be members of the Nehru family, given the context of the text. The text mentions Nehru, Indira Yunas Khan, Firoz Khan, and Indira's husband.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward description of the people in the photograph and their relationship to each other. The text does not contain any information that would be considered unusual or contrary to common sense.
The image shows a man in a suit with his hand on his forehead, looking distressed or concerned. Behind him, there is a graph with a red line that appears to be declining, and a red, spiky object that resembles a virus or a cell with a red nucleus. The text "Dec." is visible, but it is not clear what it refers to in the context of the image.  Without additional context, it is difficult to determine if there is anything in the text that goes against common sense. The image itself does not provide enough information to make a definitive statement about the content of the text. If you can provide more information or clarify the context, I may be able to offer a more informed response.
The text you provided seems to be a statement made by a midfielder named Felipe Melo, who is discussing a tactic used by the Brazilian national team against Argentina. The statement suggests that Brazil rotated their fouling on Lionel Messi during their matches, which is a common tactic in football to disrupt an opposing player's performance.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a factual statement about a tactic that has been employed in professional football. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of such tactics can be debated, as some might argue that it is unsportsmanlike or against the spirit of the game.
The text provided seems to be a statement about a protest by doctors in AIIMS Jodhpur. It mentions that the doctors are wearing bandages and carrying out a candle march in the evening. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The statement appears to be a factual description of an event.
The text you provided appears to be a statement about a potential nominee for CIA Director, Darrell Blocker, who is described as the former chief of the Africa Division within the CIA. The statement suggests that both Bernie Sanders fans and the far-right may be unhappy with this nomination.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The statement is a commentary on the political landscape and the potential reactions to a nomination. It is a reasonable assumption that different political groups may have different opinions on a nomination, and this statement reflects that.
The text "Thousands gathered in France to protest against the president" is consistent with the image, which shows a large crowd of people gathered in a public space, likely for a protest. The presence of a police van and the fact that the crowd is gathered in a street suggest that this is a public demonstration. The image does not provide any information that goes against common sense.
The text you provided appears to be a statement made by a person, which is not necessarily a factual statement. It is a common practice for governments to manipulate their currencies for various economic reasons. Whether or not China has manipulated its currency since Trump took office is a matter of debate and interpretation of economic data. It is important to note that the statement is not a factual one and should be evaluated in the context of the broader economic situation and the credibility of the source.
The text "Perseverance beams back stunning images of Mars landing" is a description of an event that has occurred. It is not a statement that goes against common sense. The image shows a spacecraft, which is indeed on Mars, and it is common sense that such a spacecraft would be equipped with cameras to capture images of its surroundings. The fact that the spacecraft is on Mars and has successfully landed is a remarkable achievement in space exploration, and the images it has sent back are indeed stunning.
The text "JUST IN Top Trump trade adviser doubles down on claim China tariffs aren't hurting US" suggests that the adviser is making a statement that contradicts the common sense understanding of tariffs. Typically, tariffs are intended to protect domestic industries by increasing the cost of imported goods, which can lead to higher prices for consumers and reduced economic activity. Therefore, it is unusual to hear a claim that tariffs are not hurting the US, as this goes against the widely accepted economic principles that tariffs can have negative effects on trade, jobs, and overall economic growth.
The image shows a schedule for a number coding scheme in Cebu City, which is a traffic regulation implemented to reduce traffic congestion. The schedule indicates that vehicles with license plates ending in specific numbers will be allowed to travel on specific days of the week.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The schedule is clear and provides specific days and times for vehicles to be allowed on the road. It is a reasonable approach to managing traffic flow in a busy urban area.  The list of exempted vehicles is also provided, which includes vehicles that are not subject to the number coding scheme. This list is typical for such regulations, as it ensures that certain types of vehicles, such as emergency vehicles, are not restricted by the number coding scheme.  The image also includes a source credit to the Cebu City Government, which is standard practice for news articles to provide the source of the information.  Overall, the text and schedule presented in the image are consistent with common sense and are part of a traffic management strategy.
The text "Budget Increases by Percent During Rouhani's Moderate Presidency" seems to be a factual statement, as it describes a specific increase in the budget during a particular presidency. However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine if the statement is accurate or if there are any inaccuracies or misleading information.  The image shows a group of military personnel, some of whom are saluting. The presence of military personnel and the context of the salute suggest that this could be a formal event or ceremony. The text does not provide any information that goes against common sense.  If you have any specific concerns about the text or the context of the image, please provide more details or ask a more targeted question.
The image you've provided appears to be a map of India, specifically focusing on the states of Jammu and Kashmir. The text in the image is a bit small and not entirely clear, but from what I can discern, it seems to be a list of dates and events related to the region.  Without a clear view of the text, it's difficult to determine if there's anything in the text that goes against common sense. However, if the text is indeed a list of dates and events, it's important to note that such lists are typically factual and based on historical records.  If you're asking about the map itself, it seems to be a standard political map of India, showing the states and union territories. There's nothing inherently against common sense in a map like this, as it's a representation of geographical boundaries and political divisions.  If you're referring to the news text, it's not visible in the image, so I can't comment on its content. If you can provide the text or a clearer image, I'd be happy to help you analyze it further.
The text you provided appears to be a news headline or a statement from a government official. It mentions the construction of a temple dedicated to Mata Kaushalya, Lord Rams mother, near Raipur.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward announcement about a proposed religious or cultural project. However, it is important to note that the construction of such a temple would require significant planning, funding, and resources, and would likely be a topic of discussion and debate among the local community and stakeholders.
The text you provided seems to be a statement about religious persecution in India, mentioning Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, and Dalit Hindus as groups that have faced persecution. However, the statement is not directly related to the image you've provided, which shows a person standing in a room with a suitcase on the floor.  The statement about religious persecution in India is a serious issue that has been reported and discussed in various media outlets. It is not a statement that goes against common sense, as it reflects a well-documented reality of religious tensions and discrimination in India.  The image you've provided does not provide any context or information that would allow for a direct assessment of the statement's accuracy. It appears to be an unrelated image, possibly taken in a public space like a train station or a waiting area.
The text in the image appears to be a statement about a person's political beliefs, specifically the wearing of a "Make Whites Great Again" hat, which is often associated with certain political ideologies. The statement suggests that the person wearing the hat should not be on the streets, implying that their political beliefs are somehow problematic or unacceptable.  However, the statement goes against common sense in several ways:  1. It makes a broad assumption about the person's character based solely on their choice of clothing. This is a form of stereotyping and discrimination, which is not acceptable in a fair and just society.  2. It implies that the person's political beliefs are the sole reason they should not be on the streets, which is a simplistic and potentially dangerous view. People should not be judged or excluded based on their political opinions.  3. It suggests that the person's political beliefs are inherently racist, which is a serious accusation that should be supported by evidence. Without evidence, such a statement is defamatory and can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts.  4. It implies that the person's political beliefs are the only factor that should be considered when determining their suitability for public service. This is a narrow and potentially biased view.  In summary, the text in the image is problematic because it promotes discrimination, stereotyping, and potentially dangerous
The text in the image is in Hindi and translates to: "After the polls, the people of West Bengal are being killed. The government is silent. The media is silent. The people are being killed. The government is silent. The media is silent."  The statement "Since postpoll violence erupted in West Bengal, old and unrelated visuals have been shared on social media." is a factual observation. It is not a statement that goes against common sense. It is a commentary on the situation in West Bengal and the use of unrelated images to depict the situation.  The images in the collage appear to show a vehicle being attacked, which is consistent with the description of post-poll violence. However, without additional context, it is not possible to determine the authenticity or relevance of these images to the situation in West Bengal.
The text provided appears to be a news article or a press release from the Navajo Nation. It discusses the current state of COVID-19 cases and vaccinations within the Navajo Nation. The text mentions that the Navajo Nation has reported 571 new cases and 28,088 total cases, with 8,891 individuals having been fully vaccinated. It also states that the Navajo Nation has reported 3,643 deaths related to COVID-19.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The information provided is consistent with what one would expect from a public health report.

The image you've provided appears to be a map overlaid with a red area, which is likely meant to represent a region of interest or concern. The text "NASA simulation shows we are even with six months' notice, we can't stop an incoming asteroid via" suggests that NASA has simulated a scenario where an asteroid is approaching Earth, and we have only six months to prepare for it.  The statement "we can't stop an incoming asteroid via" implies that there is no current technology or method available to stop an incoming asteroid. This is a common understanding in the field of asteroid science and space exploration.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense, as it accurately reflects the current state of asteroid deflection technology. It is widely recognized that stopping an incoming asteroid is a significant challenge that requires advanced technology and a long lead time to prepare for such an event.

The text you provided is a statement from Ukraine denying any involvement in the supply of rocket engines or missile technology to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). This statement is consistent with common sense, as it is not logical for Ukraine to be involved in such activities, especially given the international sanctions and condemnation against the DPRK's nuclear weapons program.  The image shows a rocket launch, which could be associated with the DPRK's missile tests. However, the text does not provide any information that contradicts the statement from Ukraine. It is important to note that the image alone does not provide enough context to determine the origin of the rocket or the circumstances of the launch.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline, which seems to be reporting on a situation involving a home for the elderly and concerns about Covid-related deaths.

This advice is consistent with common sense practices for maintaining hygiene and reducing the risk of contracting or spreading infections, especially during times when there is a heightened concern for public health, such as during a pandemic.  The image shows a person using a tissue to open a door, which is in line with the advice given in the text. This action is a practical way to reduce the risk of contamination by touching surfaces that may harbor germs.  Therefore, there is nothing in the text that goes against common sense.

The text you provided appears to be a statement made by a person, which is not necessarily a factual statement. It is a common practice for governments to manipulate their currencies for various economic reasons. Whether or not China has manipulated its currency since Trump took office is a matter of debate and interpretation of economic data. It is important to note that the statement is not a factual one and should be evaluated in the context of the broader economic situation and the credibility of the source.
The text you provided does not seem to go against common sense. It accurately reflects a statement made by President Trump regarding his tax reform plan. The statement suggests that under his plan, wealthy individuals will not be gaining at all, which is a claim that can be interpreted in different ways depending on the context of the tax reform plan. However, without additional information about the specifics of the plan, it's difficult to determine if this claim is accurate or not.
The text provided in the image appears to be a statement made by President Trump regarding his administration's policy on sanctuary cities. The statement is consistent with the actions taken by the Trump administration to withhold funds from jurisdictions that do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.  The statement itself does not go against common sense. It is a policy decision made by the administration, and it is within the legal and administrative authority of the executive branch to enforce immigration laws and to allocate federal funds.  However, the effectiveness and legality of such a policy are subject to ongoing legal challenges and debates. Some argue that it is a violation of the separation of powers and that it is an overreach of executive authority. Others argue that it is a necessary step to ensure public safety and to enforce immigration laws.  In summary, the statement itself is not against common sense, but the policy it refers to is a matter of ongoing legal and political debate.
The text provided in the image appears to be a description of a protest event. It mentions "City Residents standing along roadside at Matka Chowk in Chandigarh in Support of Farmers protest against three Farm Laws."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense.

However, it's important to note that the effectiveness of non-medical masks in preventing the spread of airborne diseases can vary depending on the type of mask and the fit. It's also important to follow other public health guidelines, such as social distancing and hand hygiene, in addition to wearing masks.
The text in the image is a myth about coronaviruses. It states that "Coronavirus itself is a virus, so only antiviral medications can work against it." This statement is not accurate and goes against common sense.  In reality, antiviral medications are designed to target specific viruses and their mechanisms of replication. While some antiviral drugs have been shown to be effective against certain coronaviruses, such as remdesivir for COVID-19, it is not the case that only antiviral medications can work against coronaviruses.  Other types of medications, such as those that modulate the immune system or treat symptoms, can also be used to manage coronavirus infections. Additionally, vaccines, which are not antiviral medications, play a crucial role in preventing and controlling the spread of coronaviruses.  The image is part of a campaign to educate people about the myths surrounding coronaviruses and to promote accurate information.
The text in the image appears to be a political statement, but it is not clear what the specific context or source of the information is.

The statement in question is: "In fact, the number of manufacturing jobs in Michigan related to motor vehicles and the manufacturing of auto parts has gone down during Mr. Trump's tenure in office."  The statement is being challenged for its accuracy, as it is claimed that the politician is lying to blue-collar voters. The text suggests that the politician is making a false claim about the state of the auto industry in Michigan during his tenure.  The statement goes against common sense because it is generally understood that the auto industry has faced significant challenges over the past few decades, including the rise of electric vehicles, the impact of global trade, and the changing nature of the workforce. It is not uncommon for politicians to make bold claims about their impact on industries, but it is important to verify such claims with accurate data and analysis.
The text "Zika concern Florida's Scott responds to state cuts for mosquito control AP Photo" is a headline from an Associated Press article.

The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a statement from a news source. It mentions that police have arrested children from a madrasa in Raja Bazar, Kolkata, and that the children are being trained to become terrorists for self-destruction. The statement also mentions that media personnel are not allowed to show the children's faces due to lack of orders from seniors.  The statement that "Most of the madrasas in India have similar training" is a generalization that may not be accurate or representative of the situation. It is important to note that the statement is not supported by any evidence or data provided in the image.  The claim that children are being trained to become terrorists is a serious allegation that would require substantial evidence to support. It is not appropriate to make such allegations without proper investigation and verification.  In general, it is important to approach news sources with a critical eye and to verify information from multiple sources before accepting it as fact.
The text you provided appears to be a news headline. It mentions that Russia may consider supplying S-300 missile systems to the Assad regime in Syria after joint air strikes.

However, it is important to note that the actual content of the news article would provide more context and details about the situation, which could be subject to interpretation and analysis.
The text in the image appears to be a statement from Eric Trump, suggesting that Joe Biden is using a teleprompter during a speech. The statement is likely intended to criticize Biden's use of a teleprompter, implying that it is somehow inappropriate or that it indicates a lack of authenticity in his speech.  However, the use of a teleprompter is a common practice for many public speakers, including politicians, to ensure that they deliver their speeches accurately and without errors. It is not necessarily an indication of insincerity or lack of authenticity. Therefore, the statement from Eric Trump is not inherently misleading or against common sense. It is a political commentary that reflects a particular perspective on the use of teleprompters in public speaking.
The text in the image appears to be a statement made by Nadia Bilbassy, which seems to be a commentary on a situation involving law enforcement and protesters. The statement reads: "Nadia Bilbassy: The police could not impose a curfew and a course of course use ..."  The statement seems to be a critique of the police's actions, suggesting that the police were unable to enforce a curfew and that their actions were not effective in managing the situation. The phrase "a course of course use" is unclear and does not make sense in the context of the statement. It's possible that there is a typo or a missing word that would clarify the intended meaning.  Without additional context, it's difficult to determine if the statement is factually accurate or if it is an opinion piece. However, the statement does not appear to go against common sense, as it seems to be a commentary on a specific event rather than a general statement about law enforcement or curfews.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline discussing the UN's stance on the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. It mentions that the UN says a new polio outbreak in Sudan is caused by oral vaccines, and that Sudan is linked to an ongoing vaccine-sparked epidemic in Chad.

The text in the image appears to be a headline or a statement attributed to Mike Pence, suggesting that he and Donald Trump have been consistent on immigration. The statement is that they have been "completely consistent" on immigration, which implies that they have held the same position or policy throughout their political careers.  Whether this statement is accurate or not would depend on the specific policies and statements made by Mike Pence and Donald Trump regarding immigration. It's important to note that political positions can evolve over time, and consistency can be subjective.  The text does not contain anything that goes against common sense in the context of the statement. However, without more context or specific examples of their positions, it's difficult to determine the accuracy of the statement.
The text in the image appears to be a statement made by Donald J. Trump, which is a political statement rather than a factual one. It is not a factual statement that can be verified as true or false. The text is a commentary on Hillary Clinton's deleted emails, which was a topic of discussion during the 2016 US presidential campaign. The statement is not something that can be proven or disproven with common sense or factual evidence.
The text in the image appears to be a description of a scene, possibly from a news report or a social media post. It mentions a plane crash near a forest, which is a serious and potentially dangerous event. However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine if there's anything in the text that goes against common sense.  Common sense would dictate that a plane crash is a rare and tragic occurrence, and that the aftermath would involve emergency services, rescue teams, and possibly a criminal investigation if the crash was due to negligence or other illegal activities. The text does not provide any information that would contradict these common sense expectations.  If there is something in the text that seems out of place or contradicts common sense, it's not immediately apparent from the image provided.
The text in the image appears to be a screenshot of a news article or a social media post discussing the Wuhan Virus, which is now known as COVID-19. The text includes statistics about the number of cases and deaths in various locations, including Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and Asia. It also mentions that the rate of infection is now at 24 cases per day.  The statement "More than people infected and people had died of the in The rate is now people per day infected, I think it's time for China to close down the borders." is a commentary on the situation and is not a factual statement. It is an opinion piece that suggests closing down the borders as a response to the number of cases and deaths.  The text does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It is a factual report of the situation, and the commentary is a reasonable response to the data presented. However, it is important to note that the situation with the Wuhan Virus is rapidly evolving, and the information in the text may have been accurate at the time the screenshot was taken, but it may not be up-to-date with the latest developments.
The image shows a group of people, likely diplomats or representatives from various countries, standing in front of a backdrop with the text "Nations Unies Conference on the Challenges of Climate Change Paris 2015." The text on the backdrop indicates that this is a conference related to climate change, and the attendees are likely there to discuss and negotiate international agreements on climate change.  The news text you provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It seems to be a standard announcement or press release related to the conference. The text mentions that the conference will be held in Paris in 2015, and it is likely that after the conference, the participating countries will need to implement the agreements reached at the conference, which may include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the use of renewable energy, and adopting more sustainable practices.  The text does not contain any information that is contrary to common sense or scientific understanding of climate change. It is consistent with the goals of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous human-induced interference with the climate system.
The text you provided is a fictional or satirical scenario that is not based on any real events. It is not a description of a news story or a factual account of an event. The text is likely meant to be humorous or to make a political statement, but it does not reflect reality.
The text in the image appears to be a news headline or a sign with information about COVID-19 testing and quarantine requirements. It mentions that people should get tested for COVID-19 before getting on a flight and that they may be required to quarantine in a hotel upon arrival.  The statement "Japan Get tested for COVID and come up before getting on a flight, get to the airport and take another test, then forced to quarantine in a hotel more test without leaving the room for days like a prisoner even though Im vaccinated" is not entirely accurate.  The first part of the statement is correct: travelers to Japan are required to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours of departure. Upon arrival, they may be subject to additional testing and may be required to quarantine in a designated facility, such as a hotel, for a certain period of time.  However, the statement that "even though Im vaccinated" is not entirely accurate. Vaccinated travelers to Japan are still subject to the same testing and quarantine requirements as unvaccinated travelers. The Japanese government has not announced any changes to its COVID-19 entry requirements for vaccinated travelers.  Therefore, while the statement correctly describes the testing and quarantine requirements for travelers to Japan, it is not entirely accurate to say that vaccinated travelers are exempt from these requirements.
The text you provided is a news headline, and it appears to be a legitimate statement based on the information available at the time the photo was taken. The headline is reporting on a call by the United States for international experts to be allowed to evaluate the source of COVID-19 and the early days of the outbreak as part of an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus.

The image shows a man speaking into a microphone, with Indian flags in the background. The text overlay on the image reads "ANI," which is a Hindi word for "India." There is no text in the image that goes against common sense. The man appears to be a public figure or a journalist, given the context of the image and the presence of the microphone. The flags in the background indicate that the setting is likely in India or related to India in some way. The text "Let me first congratulate MirabaiChanu" is not part of the image and is not related to the content of the image.
The text you provided does not seem to go against common sense. It describes a situation where a large number of farmers are protesting against agribills at the Delhi borders. This is a factual statement that aligns with what one would expect to see in the context of the image, which shows a crowd of people, some of whom are wearing turbans, which is common attire for farmers in many parts of India. The presence of a large group of people protesting in a public space is consistent with the idea of a protest or demonstration.
The text in the image states: "Scientists estimate that the Beirut explosion was equal to about kilotonnes of TNTabout of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during WWII."  This statement is not consistent with common sense or scientific understanding. The explosion in Beirut was a significant event, but it was not an atomic explosion. Atomic bombs are nuclear weapons that release a tremendous amount of energy due to the splitting of atomic nuclei, which is not the same as the explosion of a large quantity of TNT (trinitrotoluene), which is a chemical explosive.  The comparison of the Beirut explosion to the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima is misleading and inaccurate. The explosion in Beirut was a chemical explosion, likely caused by the storage and handling of ammonium nitrate, which is a common fertilizer. The comparison to the atomic bomb is an exaggeration and does not reflect the actual nature of the explosion.
The text "ABC takes down supposed Syria battle video after accuracy of footage is questioned" seems to be a statement about a specific event, which is the removal of a video from ABC (American Broadcasting Company) due to concerns about its accuracy. The statement is factual and does not go against common sense. It describes a situation where a media outlet has taken down a video after it was questioned for its accuracy.
The text provided in the image seems to be a headline from a news source, and it appears to be a straightforward description of an event. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense.

This is a typical scenario where someone might use a bike for commuting or transportation after arriving at their destination.
The text in the image contains a statement that "Mark Manuel is claimed as Abu Salem." This statement is likely to be false and goes against common sense, as Mark Manuel is a well-known actor and director in the Indian film industry, while Abu Salem is a convicted criminal and a former gangster. It is highly unlikely that Mark Manuel would be associated with Abu Salem, as they are two different individuals with distinct backgrounds and public personas. The claim made in the text is likely to be a misidentification or a piece of misinformation.
The text provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It describes a large gathering of people protesting in Naypyidaw, which is consistent with the visual content of the image showing a crowded street with many people on motorcycles and a few cars.

The text in the image states: "COVID officially declared a pandemic by the WHO, as deaths pass , by Dr. Michael J. Ryan, WHO Director-General, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO COVID-19 Technical Lead, and Dr. Michael J. Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The World Health Organization (WHO) did indeed declare COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020, as the number of cases and deaths continued to rise globally. The individuals mentioned in the text are all associated with the WHO and are likely to have been involved in the decision-making process.
The text in the image appears to be a promotional or informational banner for an event related to legal and economic perspectives on Mexican politics. It mentions Enrique Quintana, Vice President of the General Editorial of El Financiero, as the speaker for the event. The text does not contain any information about Moderna or Pfizer vaccines or their reliance on messenger RNA. Therefore, there is no information in the text that goes against common sense regarding the vaccines. The text is focused on the event and the speaker, and there is no mention of vaccines or their mechanisms.
The text in the image reads "COVID vaccine could be ready December U." This statement is not necessarily against common sense, as it is a plausible scenario given the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines. However, it is important to note that the timeline for vaccine development and approval is typically much longer than December of the same year. The statement suggests that the vaccine could be ready for use by December, which would be an unprecedented timeline for such a complex and rigorous process. This could be seen as optimistic or ambitious, but it is not inherently against common sense.
The text in the image is a call to action from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to visit their website for the latest information on the coronavirus. It is a directive from a reputable health organization, and there is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The CDC is a trusted source of health information, and their recommendations are based on scientific evidence and public health guidelines.
The text provided in the image appears to be a description of a project related to the Ram Mandir at Ayodhya, which is a proposed Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Ram.

The text in the image appears to be a slogan or a message related to a protest or demonstration. It mentions "Hindustan Zindabaad," which translates to "Long live India," and "Pakistan Muradabad," which translates to "Down with Pakistan." These slogans are commonly associated with anti-Pakistan sentiment in India, particularly in the context of the Kashmir region.  The text also mentions "Durga Solidarity with the victims of the terror attacks in Mumbai on 26/11/2008," which refers to the 2008 Mumbai attacks, a series of coordinated terrorist attacks that took place in Mumbai, India. The attacks resulted in the deaths of over 160 people and injured hundreds more.  The slogan "Durga Solidarity with the victims of the terror attacks in Mumbai on 26/11/2008" suggests that the protestors are expressing solidarity with the victims of the Mumbai attacks.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The slogans are clear and the message is consistent with the context of the protest, which is likely related to the aftermath of the Mumbai attacks and the ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan.
The text in the image states, "There is no cure for Coronavirus yet." This statement is accurate and aligns with common sense, as there is currently no cure for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The text is providing factual information and does not go against common sense.
The text in the image appears to be a statement made by a person, which seems to be a commentary on the approval ratings of a political figure, specifically Donald Trump, among Black Americans. The statement is "No Donald, Your Approval Ratings With Black Americans Hasn't Doubled."  The statement is factual and does not go against common sense. It is based on the information available at the time the image was taken, which is likely a snapshot of the political climate at that moment. The statement is not making a claim that is inherently contradictory or illogical.  However, it is important to note that approval ratings can change over time, and the statement may not be accurate if it was made after the approval ratings had changed. Additionally, approval ratings can be influenced by various factors, including political events, public opinion, and media coverage, which can change rapidly.
The text "Fire breaks out in cracker market in Agras Sultanpur" seems to be a straightforward description of an event. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It appears to be a factual statement about a fire that occurred in a cracker market in Agras Sultanpur.

The text you provided seems to be a statement about a political situation, specifically mentioning Tejasvi Surya, a politician from India, and Dilip Ghosh, a leader from the BJP party. The statement appears to be making a point about the political climate in Bengal, but it's not clear what the specific context or issue is that Tejasvi Surya is protesting about.

The image shows a person sitting on a stool with their hand on their chin, which is a common pose for contemplation or thoughtfulness. The person is wearing a white jacket and white pants, and the background features a colorful wall with graffiti.  Without additional context, it's difficult to determine the accuracy or relevance of the statement to the image. It's important to note that political statements can be subjective and may not always align with the visual content of an image.
The text you provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It describes a solar storm approaching Earth, which is a natural phenomenon that occurs when the sun releases a large amount of energy and particles into space.

The statement about the speed of the solar storm is consistent with the known behavior of solar storms, which can travel at speeds of millions of miles per hour.
The image and text appear to be a screenshot from a social media platform, possibly a news article or a post with a news-related headline. The text mentions an exclusive report about an incident involving a DMK (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) party leader named Selvakumar. It states that he allegedly assaulted a lady doctor on duty.  The text also includes a quote from the lady doctor, which seems to be a direct statement from her, indicating that she was assaulted by Selvakumar. The context suggests that this is a serious allegation of misconduct.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The statement is clear and seems to be a straightforward reporting of an alleged incident. The text does not contain any information that would be considered unusual or out of the ordinary for a news report.
The text you provided appears to be a summary of a statement made by a witness during a congressional hearing. The statement refers to a "quid pro quo" arrangement, which is a Latin phrase meaning "something for something." In this context, it suggests that a top State Department official offered a deal to the FBI in exchange for something.  The statement is not inherently against common sense. It is a common practice for individuals to negotiate or make deals in exchange for something they want or need. However, the specifics of the deal and the context in which it was offered are not provided in the text, so it's not possible to determine if the deal was ethical or appropriate.  The text also mentions that the witness is a top State Department official, which could imply that the deal was made within the context of the U.S. government. The implications of such a deal would depend on the details of the offer and the context in which it was made.  Without more context or information, it's not possible to determine if the deal was ethical or appropriate. It's important to consider the full context of the situation and the specifics of the deal when evaluating the implications of such an arrangement.
The text provided does not seem to go against common sense. It describes a situation where there are "disturbing scenes of violence against peaceful farmers protesting for their rights." This statement is consistent with what one would expect to read in a news report about a protest, as it describes a conflict between peaceful protesters and those who are using violence. The text does not contain any information that would be considered contrary to common sense.
The text in the image states, "Bokuto-san... You need to remember to bring your umbrella." This statement is not related to the news text provided, which discusses the findings of a study on COVID-19 symptoms. The text in the image is a fictional conversation from an anime or manga, and it does not provide any information about the study mentioned in the news text. Therefore, there is no contradiction between the two pieces of information.

The statement is that President Trump believes Cuomo never asked Blumenthal about Blumenthal's claim of serving in Vietnam.  The statement is not inherently against common sense. It is a statement about an event that took place, which is a common type of statement. However, the accuracy of the statement would depend on the context of the press conference and the specific circumstances surrounding the interaction between Cuomo and Blumenthal.  It's important to note that the truthfulness of a statement made by a public figure is not always immediately clear and often requires further investigation to determine its accuracy.
The text in the image reads: "Protect yourself and others. Please wear a mask or face covering in all common areas." This message is consistent with public health guidelines that recommend wearing masks or face coverings in public spaces to help prevent the spread of airborne particles, including those that may contain viruses. The message is clear and aligns with common sense practices for maintaining personal and public health during times of heightened concern for infectious diseases.
The text in the image appears to be a factual statement about a helicopter crash that occurred in Los Angeles. It does not contain any information that goes against common sense. The statement is clear and concise, providing details about the location of the crash and the number of people involved.
The text in the image appears to be a headline from a news source, which seems to be discussing a topic related to trade and tariffs. The headline reads: "STUDY: U.S. Importers, Not China, Paying for Most of Tariffs."  The statement "STUDY: U.S. Importers, Not China, Paying for Most of Tariffs" is a factual statement based on the information provided by the study. It suggests that the costs of tariffs are being borne by U.S. importers rather than by China. This is a common sense interpretation of the study's findings, as tariffs are typically taxes imposed on imported goods, and the burden of these taxes falls on the importers.  The rest of the text in the image seems to be a summary of a news segment or interview, which is likely discussing the implications of this study for trade policy and consumer prices. The text does not contain any information that goes against common sense.
The text you provided appears to be a humorous or satirical statement, as it attributes a request for dog food to an Italian journalist and suggests that it is being made to Mike Pompeo. The statement is not based on any credible news or information and is likely intended to be a joke or a piece of fictional dialogue.  The statement goes against common sense because it attributes a bizarre and unrealistic request to a serious political figure, and it does so in a way that is not consistent with how diplomatic interactions typically occur. It is not common for journalists to make such requests during official meetings or press conferences, and it is not typical for political figures to discuss or accept such requests.  The statement is also likely intended to be a play on words, as "dog food" can be a metaphor for something that is considered low-quality or unappealing, and the phrase "making Americans faithful" could be a reference to the idea that the dog food might be used to control or influence the behavior of the American public. However, this is a fictional scenario and not based on any real events or interactions.
The text in the image states, "More than lakh people emerge at the Joint Rally of Congress and CPIM at Brigade Ground in the Heart of."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The term "lakh" refers to a unit of measurement in the Indian numbering system, equivalent to 100,000. The text is describing a large gathering of people at a political rally, which is consistent with the scale of such events. The term "emerge" suggests that the crowd has assembled and is now visible, which is a typical occurrence at such events. The location, Brigade Ground, is a well-known venue in Bangalore, India, which is known for hosting large-scale events. The text is providing a factual description of the event.
The text in the image appears to be a headline or a statement about a tragic event. It mentions Gianna Bryant, who is known to be the daughter of Kobe Bryant, and suggests that she was showing off her basketball skills before the incident. The text also includes the word "breaking," which is commonly used to indicate that new information about an event has been released.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a straightforward statement about a tragic event, and it does not contain any information that would be considered unusual or counterintuitive. The text is likely intended to convey the shock and sadness surrounding the death of Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna.
The text in the image appears to be a headline or a summary of a news story. It states, "Defiant Trump falsely insists election was rigged at rally for Georgia Senate Republicans."  The statement "Defiant Trump falsely insists election was rigged" is a subjective interpretation of an event and is not inherently against common sense. However, the phrase "falsely insists" implies that the statement is not based on factual evidence and is therefore misleading.  The claim that the election was rigged is a controversial and unsubstantiated allegation that has been widely disputed by election officials, experts, and the courts. While it is within the realm of free speech to express such a belief, it is not supported by the available evidence.  The rest of the text, "at rally for Georgia Senate Republicans," is a factual statement that describes the context of the event where the statement was made.
The image you've provided appears to be a historical photograph showing a group of nurses and medical equipment from a past era, likely from the early to mid-20th century. The text you've provided is a statement attributed to a person named "Trump."  The statement "Trump says that with or without a vaccine, coronavirus will just go away at some point" is not consistent with the scientific consensus on the COVID-19 pandemic. The statement goes against common sense and the understanding of how infectious diseases spread and are controlled.  The scientific consensus, based on extensive research and evidence, is that vaccines are a crucial tool in preventing the spread of infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Vaccines work by stimulating the body's immune system to produce an immune response, which helps the body fight off the disease. This can prevent the disease from spreading to others and reduce the overall impact of the disease on a population.  The statement also contradicts the advice of public health experts, who recommend vaccination as a key measure to control the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. The statement is not supported by scientific evidence and is not in line with the recommendations of health organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  Therefore, the statement "Trump says that with or without a vaccine, coronavirus
The text in the image appears to be a message related to Muharram, which is the first month of the Islamic calendar. It seems to be a call for sharing the message and praying for Kashmir. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense; it is a typical message one might find during the holy month of Muharram, encouraging people to remember and support the people of Kashmir.
The text you provided seems to be a statement about the difficulty of stopping an incoming asteroid, even with advanced warning. It suggests that despite having six months' notice, humanity would still be unable to prevent an asteroid impact. This statement is consistent with the current understanding of asteroid impacts and the limitations of our technology and capabilities to deflect or destroy such objects.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It reflects the reality of the situation as we currently understand it. However, it's important to note that this is a simplified statement and the actual situation is more complex, with ongoing research and development of technologies that could potentially mitigate the impact of an asteroid.
The text in the image appears to be a mix of statements and wishes related to the Indian space program and the Vikram Lander. The text mentions that "CHEERS to our SCIENTISTS INDIA is on the Moon" and that "Orbiter has sent Thermal Image of VikramLander." It also expresses a wish for communication to revive the Vikram Lander.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a statement of support and encouragement for the Indian space program and its achievements, as well as a hope for the successful communication with the Vikram Lander. The text is consistent with the context of the image, which shows the Moon with the Indian flag and the Vikram Lander, indicating a connection to the Indian space program.
The image shows a person working with cannabis plants, which is a legal activity in many places where cannabis cultivation is permitted.

The text in the image reads, "No one is above the law!".

The text is clear and does not contain any information that is obviously contradictory or nonsensical.
The text in the image appears to be a statement from a news source, specifically Politifact, which is known for fact-checking statements made by public figures. The statement in question is about a claim made by former President Donald Trump regarding a billion dollars going missing at the State Department under President Bill Clinton.  The statement "Trump wrongly says billion went missing at State Department under Clinton" is a factual statement made by Politifact. It is not something that goes against common sense, as it is a straightforward assessment of a statement made by a public figure.  However, it is worth noting that the statement is a factual one and not a statement of common sense. Common sense is a term that is often used to describe knowledge or understanding that is not based on formal education or training, but rather on practical experience and everyday observation.  In this case, the statement from Politifact is based on factual reporting and analysis, rather than common sense. It is a statement of fact, not a statement of common sense.
The text provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It accurately describes the situation depicted in the image, which shows a group of people, some of whom are wearing helmets and carrying sticks, confronting a group of police officers.

It's important to verify such claims with reliable sources before accepting them as fact.
The text you provided is a sensationalized and misleading headline. It is not supported by any credible news sources or evidence. The idea of a pregnant elephant being fed a pineapple filled with explosives is not only absurd but also impossible, as it defies the laws of physics and biology.  The image you've shared shows an elephant standing in water with a barbed wire fence in front of it. The elephant appears to be calmly drinking water. There is no indication in the image or the text that the elephant is pregnant or has been harmed in any way.  The headline is likely intended to provoke shock and outrage, but it is important to critically evaluate the sources of such information and to avoid spreading misinformation.
The text you provided appears to be a headline from a news source. However, the text is incomplete and does not provide enough context to determine if it is accurate or if it goes against common sense. The headline mentions a "Hathras girl" who is said to have been raped by a minor cousin and died at Delhi.  The headline raises several questions and concerns:  1. The age of the victim is mentioned as 19, which is not consistent with the term "minor cousin." This could be a typographical error or a misleading statement. 2. The headline does not provide any information about the circumstances of the alleged rape or the cause of the victim's death. 3. The headline does not provide any information about the identity of the alleged perpetrator or the status of the investigation.  Without additional context or information, it is not possible to determine if the headline is accurate or if it goes against common sense. It is important to verify news sources and to be cautious when sharing or discussing information from unverified sources.
The text in the image appears to be a call to action or a statement of solidarity with a cause. It mentions "thousands gathered in France to protest against the president" and "the whole world will rise," which suggests a global response to a specific issue.

There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense, as it is a clear and direct statement of a political position and a call to action. However, it is important to note that the accuracy of the information in the text and the context in which it was made would need to be verified through reliable sources.
The text in the image appears to be a statement made by a person, possibly a journalist or a witness, regarding an incident involving students of Jamia. The statement suggests that a group of people, referred to as a "mob," engaged in violent actions such as arson and stone-throwing.  The statement is consistent with what one might expect to hear in the aftermath of a violent event, where there is often a need to describe the actions of the perpetrators. However, without additional context or evidence, it is not possible to determine the accuracy of the statement.  The text does not contain anything that goes against common sense in the sense of being logically inconsistent or contradictory. It is a straightforward description of events as they were reported or witnessed.
The text in the image appears to be a sign indicating that the COVID-19 vaccination area is appointment-only and that CVS requires check-in and scheduling. There is no text in the image that goes against common sense. The sign is providing information about the vaccination process and the requirements for getting a COVID-19 vaccine at CVS.
The text "Video shows aftermath of the Kobe Bryant helicopter crash" is consistent with common sense. It describes a situation where a helicopter crash has occurred, and the image shows the aftermath of that event. The presence of a helicopter in the sky and the mention of a building and a fire truck suggest that there has been an incident involving a helicopter, which is consistent with the information provided.
The text you provided appears to be a sensationalized headline or a statement that is not supported by any credible sources. It makes allegations about the Clinton Foundation and a cargo ship, which are not substantiated by any publicly available evidence.  The statement "BOMBSHELL Drugs, Illegal Foods For Terrorists Allegedly Found On Seized Clinton Foundation Cargo Ship" is not consistent with common sense or the known facts about the Clinton Foundation and any cargo ship. The Clinton Foundation is a non-profit organization that focuses on global health, education, and economic development. It is not involved in the illegal trade of drugs or food for terrorists.  Furthermore, the idea of a cargo ship being seized and containing illegal drugs or food for terrorists is highly improbable and would require substantial evidence to support. Such a claim would be highly unusual and would likely be reported by major news outlets if it were true.  In summary, the text you provided is not consistent with common sense or known facts and appears to be a sensationalized or misleading statement.
The image you've provided appears to be a screenshot from a video, with a text overlay that includes a fact-checking statement. The statement reads: "FAKE: Old, cropped video shared with false claim that Arvind Kejriwal is threatening Gujaratis."  The text overlay is a fact-checking statement, which suggests that the video being referred to is not a recent event and has been manipulated or taken out of context to create a false narrative. The statement is clear and does not go against common sense. It is a straightforward assessment of the video's authenticity and the context in which it is being shared.
The text provided does not contain any information that goes against common sense. It is a factual statement about the Cassini spacecraft and its orbit around Saturn.
The text in the image appears to be a political statement or a claim made by a social media account. It suggests that the Clinton Foundation accepted money from a Russian company in exchange for the approval of a uranium deal.  The statement is making a causal connection between a donation to the Clinton Foundation and a specific government action, which is not a typical way that government decisions are made. The text implies that the donation influenced the decision-making process, which is a serious allegation.  However, without more context or evidence, it is not possible to determine the accuracy of this claim. It is important to critically evaluate such statements and to seek out reliable sources of information to form an informed opinion.
The text provided in the image seems to be a description of a photo story, but it contains a statement that is not supported by the images: "Palestinian boy who thought his brother had been killed after the Gaza bombing hugs him when he sees him."  The images show two young boys embracing each other, but there is no indication in the images that one of the boys had been killed or that the other boy had been mistakenly informed of his brother's death. The text seems to be an interpretation or a narrative added to the images, which is not evident from the images themselves.  The text also mentions "that became global," which is not a factual statement. It is not clear what the author is referring to, as there is no context provided.  The rest of the text appears to be a description of the image content, which is consistent with what can be seen in the images.
The image shows a group of women standing together, holding flags and banners, and it appears that they are participating in a protest or demonstration. The text in the image suggests that they are farmers and are raising their voices against the government.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The text is consistent with the visual content of the image, which shows a group of people engaged in a public demonstration. The text and the image together convey a message of activism and collective action by the group of women.
The text you provided is a tweet by former US President Donald Trump. The tweet claims that his State of the Union (SOTU) address had the highest number of viewers in history. However, this statement is not accurate.  According to Nielsen, the company that measures television viewership in the United States, the highest-rated SOTU address in history was given by President Bill Clinton in 1998, with an estimated 65.6 million viewers. This was followed by President Barack Obama's first SOTU address in 2009, which had an estimated 52.3 million viewers. President Trump's SOTU address in 2019 had an estimated 46.4 million viewers, which is lower than both of the aforementioned addresses.  Therefore, the statement in the tweet is not accurate and goes against common sense, as it is easily verifiable that other presidents had higher viewership for their SOTU addresses.
The text in the image appears to be a screenshot of a social media post with a caption that reads: "Flash back to QuadenBayles first Easter in 2011 age 4 month old. #MySonShine #AlwaysBeMyBabyCutie."  The caption seems to be a heartfelt message from a parent, possibly sharing a special moment from their child's life. There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a typical post one might find on social media, celebrating a milestone or a special occasion in a child's life.
The image appears to be a promotional or informational graphic related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). The text on the image mentions "COVID-19 POLICY DOCUMENTS SERIES" and "UNDP LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN," which suggests that the content is related to the United Nations Development Program's work in the region.  The graphic includes a stylized representation of the COVID-19 virus, which is a common visual used to represent the virus. Below the virus, there is a line graph that seems to be illustrating some sort of economic trend, possibly related to the economic impact of the pandemic.  The text "www.latinamerica.undp.org" is provided, which is the website of the UNDP's work in Latin America and the Caribbean. The hashtag "#COVID19" is also present, which is a widely recognized hashtag for content related to the coronavirus pandemic.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. The graphic is likely intended to inform viewers about the policy documents related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the LAC region and how the UNDP is involved in addressing the economic impact of the pandemic.
The text in the image states, "Donald Trump is wrong that Americans don't care about his tax returns." This statement is not inherently against common sense, as it is a factual assertion about public opinion regarding the release of President Trump's tax returns. However, the statement could be considered controversial or subject to interpretation, depending on one's perspective on the issue.
The image shows a person holding a Confederate flag, which is often associated with symbols of the Confederate States of America (CSA) during the American Civil War. The CSA was a group of 11 Southern states that seceded from the United States and fought against the Union in the Civil War. The flag is a symbol of the CSA and has been controversial due to its association with slavery, racism, and the Civil War.  The text "January , ." is not clear enough to provide any context or information that would go against common sense. It appears to be a fragment of text, possibly a date or a sentence, but without additional context, it's difficult to determine its relevance to the image or the situation depicted.
The text in the image appears to be a headline or a summary of a news article. It mentions "China attempted to capture Galwan Valley as a preemptive measure to stall this DBO Road infrastructure project in Ladakh."  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense.

However, it is important to note that without additional context or a source for the information, it is not possible to verify the accuracy of the statement.
The text in the image does not provide any information that goes against common sense. It simply states that the image does not show a fox breastfeeding orphaned koala babies in Australia. This is a factual statement that is consistent with the image, which shows a fox with its young, but no koalas are present.
The image shows a wall with various medical devices and equipment, including a blood pressure monitor, a stethoscope, and a pulse oximeter. There is no news text visible in the image to provide information about insurers pulling out of Obamacare.  Regarding your question about insurers pulling out of Obamacare, it's important to note that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare, has faced challenges and changes over the years. Some insurers have indeed left the ACA marketplaces, citing financial losses and the need to adjust their business models. However, it's also worth noting that the ACA has helped to reduce the number of uninsured Americans and has provided essential health benefits to millions of people.  As for the news text, without seeing it, I can't comment on whether it contains anything that goes against common sense. News text should be factual and based on reliable sources, but it's always important to critically evaluate news sources and their credibility.
The text provided in the image appears to be a statement about an event that occurred in Wisconsin. It suggests that "violent leftist radicals" burned down a church, despite the presence of a "Black lives matter" sign.  The statement is likely to be controversial and may be seen as inflammatory or inaccurate by some. It is important to note that the text is a single sentence and does not provide any context or evidence to support the claims made. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from the text alone whether the statement is factually accurate or not.  In general, it is important to approach such statements with caution and to seek out reliable sources of information to verify the accuracy of any claims made.
The text in the image appears to be a statement made by Hillary Clinton during an interview. It is not a direct quote from FBI Director James Comey, but rather a statement attributed to him by Clinton. The statement is that Comey said she was "truthful" about her email server.  It is important to note that this statement is not consistent with the statements made by James Comey during his testimony before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in July 2016. In his testimony, Comey did not use the word "truthful" to describe Clinton's statements about her email server. Instead, he said that Clinton had been "extremely careless" in handling classified information.  Therefore, the statement made by Hillary Clinton in the image is not accurate according to the statements made by James Comey during his testimony.
The text you provided states, "Indian army are brutally hitting kashmiri Women." This statement is a serious allegation and is not something that can be confirmed or denied from the image alone. It is important to note that images can be misleading and do not always provide the full context of a situation.  The image shows a group of individuals, some of whom appear to be in uniform, and there is a person on the ground who seems to be in distress. However, without additional information, it is not possible to determine the circumstances leading up to this moment or the identities of the individuals involved.  It is crucial to approach such situations with caution and to rely on credible sources for information. The statement you provided is a serious accusation and would require further investigation to determine its accuracy.
The text appears to be a press release or statement regarding the results of an election in Tanzania. It mentions that the ACT Wazalendo Party has rejected the announced election results and is calling for fresh elections. The text also discusses the challenges faced by the ACT Wazalendo Party, including the alleged use of violence and intimidation by the ruling party.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense. It is a statement of political opposition and a call for electoral reform, which is a common occurrence in democratic societies when there are disputes over the fairness of election results. The text is consistent with the expectations of a political statement, expressing dissatisfaction with the election outcome and advocating for a redress of grievances through fresh elections.
The text in the image states, "Trump repeats false claim that his poll numbers are higher than Lincoln's." This statement is factual and does not go against common sense. It is a widely reported fact that President Trump has made this false claim about his poll numbers being higher than those of Abraham Lincoln.
The text you provided seems to be a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of the concept of "Covid immunity." It suggests that wearing face masks may be giving people immunity to COVID-19 and making them less sick from the coronavirus.  However, this statement goes against common sense and scientific understanding of how immunity works. Face masks do not provide immunity to COVID-19 or any other disease. They are designed to prevent the spread of respiratory droplets that can contain the virus, which helps to reduce the transmission of the virus from one person to another.  The statement is likely a misrepresentation of the scientific evidence, which has shown that face masks can reduce the risk of transmission, but they do not provide immunity. It is important to rely on credible sources of information for accurate and up-to-date information about health and safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The text in the image appears to be a headline from a news source, and it states: "George Soros Arrested in Philadelphia on Election Interference Charges and is Being Held in Federal Custody, According to Reports."  The headline seems to be a sensationalized or misleading statement, as it suggests that George Soros has been arrested for election interference, which is a serious charge. However, the text does not provide any credible sources or evidence to support this claim.  It is important to note that the image shows a screenshot of a webpage, and the headline is likely intended to attract attention and generate clicks, rather than accurately report the news. The content of the headline does not align with common sense or established facts, as there is no credible evidence to support the claim that George Soros has been arrested for election interference.  The headline is likely a form of clickbait, designed to provoke a strong emotional response and encourage people to share or engage with the content, regardless of its accuracy.
The text appears to be a screenshot of a social media post with a caption that seems to be a humorous take on a situation, possibly related to Paul Pogba's involvement with the French National Team. The text is written in a way that exaggerates the situation for comedic effect, which is a common practice on social media.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense in terms of the content itself. It's a playful commentary on a public figure's actions, which is a common form of humor. However, it's important to note that humor can be subjective, and what one person finds funny, another might not.  The text mentions that Pogba is "100% unfounded news about me are going around," which is a common sentiment when there are rumors or speculation about a person's actions or decisions. It also mentions that Pogba is "absolutely shocked and frustrated some 'media'" sources use me to make total fake headlines in the senseless subject of French National Team to the pot. I am against any and all forms of terror and violence. Unfortunately, some press people don't act responsibly when writing the news, abusing their power to create a gossip chain without caring it affects people's lives and my life. I am taking legal action against the publishers and spreaders of these 100% fake
The text in the image appears to be a headline or a statement attributed to Vice President Mike Pence. It reads: "Pence: Trump has been 'completely consistent' on immigration plan—no amnesty, no path to legalization'."  The statement is a political position and is likely to be interpreted differently by different individuals based on their political views. Some might argue that the statement is consistent with the Trump administration's stance on immigration, which has been characterized by a focus on border security and a desire to limit or end certain immigration programs. Others might argue that the statement is inconsistent with the Trump administration's actions, which have included the implementation of policies that have been criticized for being harsh on immigrants, including the separation of families at the border and the termination of programs like DACA.  Whether the statement is consistent with common sense depends on one's perspective on immigration policy. Some might view the statement as a straightforward reflection of the Trump administration's policy positions, while others might argue that the administration's actions have not been consistent with its rhetoric.
The text in the image appears to be a stock market chart for Infibeam, a company that was once known as Infibeam Avenues Ltd.

However, this statement is not based on common sense or logical reasoning.  Firstly, Sally Field's SAG Awards win is a personal achievement and does not have a direct impact on the need for more school drama programs. It is not logical to assume that one person's success is the sole reason for a change in educational policies or programs.  Secondly, the statement assumes that Sally Field's success is a result of her participation in school drama programs. While it is possible that her involvement in drama programs during her school years contributed to her success, it is not reasonable to assume that this is the only factor that led to her success.  In conclusion, the statement "We Need More School Drama Programs After Sally Field's SAG Awards Win" is not based on common sense or logical reasoning and is therefore not a valid argument.

The statement is not factually incorrect, as abortion is indeed a healthcare service for many individuals. However, the phrase "fundamental right to human rights" is somewhat ambiguous and could be interpreted in different ways. It's not clear what the protestor means by "fundamental right to human rights," as human rights are generally understood to encompass a wide range of rights, including civil and political rights, as well as economic, social, and cultural rights.

The interpretation of the Second Amendment and its application to specific laws and regulations is a matter of ongoing legal debate and has been the subject of numerous court cases.

The text "See Joseph Gordon Levitt Make His Poker Face Debut" is a playful and fictional scenario, as it is not possible for a person to make their "poker face" debut. A poker face is a neutral facial expression that is difficult to read, often used in poker to hide one's emotions and strategy. Since Joseph Gordon-Levitt is an actor, it is not logical to expect him to make a "poker face" debut, as he would have already been exposed to various roles and expressions in his acting career. The text is likely meant to be humorous or to create a sense of intrigue, rather than to depict a real event.

The man is wearing a bow tie, and the woman has curly hair. The setting appears to be an indoor space, possibly a room with a brick wall.  Without more information, it's not possible to determine if the text is making a statement that goes against common sense or if it's simply a humorous or satirical commentary on the image.

However, the image itself is not a legitimate source of information about tax returns, and the text is likely included for dramatic effect or as part of a fictional scenario.  The image is designed to look like a collage of various documents, including what appears to be a face, possibly to create a sense of intrigue or to suggest a narrative that is not based on fact. The overall impression is that of a staged or artistic representation, rather than a genuine document or news report.

However, the headline does indicate a legal action, which is a common way to address disagreements or challenges to regulations.  The image itself shows a large cruise ship sailing on the water, which is a common sight in many coastal areas. The presence of people in the water near the ship suggests that the ship is in operation and that the location is likely a popular spot for recreational activities.  Without more context or information about the specifics of the legal action, it is not possible to determine if the text goes against common sense.

The text provided in the image is consistent with common sense and reflects a typical economic policy action taken by central banks, such as the Federal Reserve (often referred to as "the Fed"). The statement "The Fed is hitting the brakes on its bond buying program as it begins to scale back economic support it provided throughout the pandemic" is a clear and accurate description of the actions taken by the Federal Reserve in response to the economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Federal Reserve, like other central banks, uses monetary policy tools to manage the economy. One of the most significant tools is quantitative easing (QE), which involves the purchase of government bonds and other securities to inject liquidity into the financial system. This is done to stimulate economic growth, lower interest rates, and prevent deflation.  During the pandemic, the Federal Reserve significantly increased its QE program to support the economy. As the economy recovers and inflation rises, central banks typically begin to reduce the size of their QE programs to prevent inflation from becoming too high. This is what the text is referring to when it says "hitting the brakes" on the bond buying program.  There is nothing in the text that goes against common sense or is inconsistent with the actions taken by central banks during economic recoveries.
